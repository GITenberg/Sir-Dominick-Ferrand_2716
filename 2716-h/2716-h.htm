<h1>SIR DOMINICK FERRAND.</h1>
<h2>I.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">There</span> are several objections
to it, but I&rsquo;ll take it if you&rsquo;ll alter it,&rdquo;
Mr. Locket&rsquo;s rather curt note had said; and there was no
waste of words in the postscript in which he had added: &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;ll come in and see me, I&rsquo;ll show you what I
mean.&rdquo;&nbsp; This communication had reached Jersey Villas
by the first post, and Peter Baron had scarcely swallowed his
leathery muffin before he got into motion to obey the editorial
behest.&nbsp; He knew that such precipitation looked eager, and
he had no desire to look eager&mdash;it was not in his interest;
but how could he maintain a godlike calm, principled though he
was in favour of it, the first time one of the great magazines
had accepted, even with a cruel reservation, a specimen of his
ardent young genius?</p>
<p>It was not till, like a child with a sea-shell at his ear, he
began to be aware of the great roar of the
&ldquo;underground,&rdquo; that, in his third-class carriage, the
cruelty of the reservation penetrated, with the taste of acrid
smoke, to his inner sense.&nbsp; It was really degrading to be
eager in the face of having to &ldquo;alter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter
Baron tried to figure to himself at that moment that he was not
flying to betray the extremity of his need, but hurrying to fight
for some of those passages of superior boldness which were
exactly what the conductor of the &ldquo;Promiscuous
Review&rdquo; would be sure to be down upon.&nbsp; He made
believe&mdash;as if to the greasy fellow-passenger
opposite&mdash;that he felt indignant; but he saw that to the
small round eye of this still more downtrodden brother he
represented selfish success.&nbsp; He would have liked to linger
in the conception that he had been &ldquo;approached&rdquo; by
the Promiscuous; but whatever might be thought in the office of
that periodical of some of his flights of fancy, there was no
want of vividness in his occasional suspicion that he passed
there for a familiar bore.&nbsp; The only thing that was clearly
flattering was the fact that the Promiscuous rarely published
fiction.&nbsp; He should therefore be associated with a deviation
from a solemn habit, and that would more than make up to him for
a phrase in one of Mr. Locket&rsquo;s inexorable earlier notes, a
phrase which still rankled, about his showing no symptom of the
faculty really creative.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem able
to keep a character together,&rdquo; this pitiless monitor had
somewhere else remarked.&nbsp; Peter Baron, as he sat in his
corner while the train stopped, considered, in the befogged
gaslight, the bookstall standard of literature and asked himself
whose character had fallen to pieces now.&nbsp; Tormenting indeed
had always seemed to him such a fate as to have the creative head
without the creative hand.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned, however, that before he started on his
mission to Mr. Locket his attention had been briefly engaged by
an incident occurring at Jersey Villas.&nbsp; On leaving the
house (he lived at No.&nbsp; 3, the door of which stood open to a
small front garden), he encountered the lady who, a week before,
had taken possession of the rooms on the ground floor, the
&ldquo;parlours&rdquo; of Mrs. Bundy&rsquo;s terminology.&nbsp;
He had heard her, and from his window, two or three times, had
even seen her pass in and out, and this observation had created
in his mind a vague prejudice in her favour.&nbsp; Such a
prejudice, it was true, had been subjected to a violent test; it
had been fairly apparent that she had a light step, but it was
still less to be overlooked that she had a cottage piano.&nbsp;
She had furthermore a little boy and a very sweet voice, of which
Peter Baron had caught the accent, not from her singing (for she
only played), but from her gay admonitions to her child, whom she
occasionally allowed to amuse himself&mdash;under restrictions
very publicly enforced&mdash;in the tiny black patch which, as a
forecourt to each house, was held, in the humble row, to be a
feature.&nbsp; Jersey Villas stood in pairs, semi-detached, and
Mrs. Ryves&mdash;such was the name under which the new lodger
presented herself&mdash;had been admitted to the house as
confessedly musical.&nbsp; Mrs. Bundy, the earnest proprietress
of No. 3, who considered her &ldquo;parlours&rdquo; (they were a
dozen feet square), even more attractive, if possible, than the
second floor with which Baron had had to content
himself&mdash;Mrs. Bundy, who reserved the drawing-room for a
casual dressmaking business, had threshed out the subject of the
new lodger in advance with our young man, reminding him that her
affection for his own person was a proof that, other things being
equal, she positively preferred tenants who were clever.</p>
<p>This was the case with Mrs. Ryves; she had satisfied Mrs.
Bundy that she was not a simple strummer.&nbsp; Mrs. Bundy
admitted to Peter Baron that, for herself, she had a weakness for
a pretty tune, and Peter could honestly reply that his ear was
equally sensitive.&nbsp; Everything would depend on the
&ldquo;touch&rdquo; of their inmate.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s
piano would blight his existence if her hand should prove heavy
or her selections vulgar; but if she played agreeable things and
played them in an agreeable way she would render him rather a
service while he smoked the pipe of &ldquo;form.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mrs. Bundy, who wanted to let her rooms, guaranteed on the part
of the stranger a first-class talent, and Mrs. Ryves, who
evidently knew thoroughly what she was about, had not falsified
this somewhat rash prediction.&nbsp; She never played in the
morning, which was Baron&rsquo;s working-time, and he found
himself listening with pleasure at other hours to her discreet
and melancholy strains.&nbsp; He really knew little about music,
and the only criticism he would have made of Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s
conception of it was that she seemed devoted to the dismal.&nbsp;
It was not, however, that these strains were not pleasant to him;
they floated up, on the contrary, as a sort of conscious response
to some of his broodings and doubts.&nbsp; Harmony, therefore,
would have reigned supreme had it not been for the singularly bad
taste of No. 4.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s piano was on the free
side of the house and was regarded by Mrs. Bundy as open to no
objection but that of their own gentleman, who was so
reasonable.&nbsp; As much, however, could not be said of the
gentleman of No. 4, who had not even Mr. Baron&rsquo;s excuse of
being &ldquo;littery&rdquo; (he kept a bull-terrier and had five
hats&mdash;the street could count them), and whom, if you had
listened to Mrs. Bundy, you would have supposed to be divided
from the obnoxious instrument by walls and corridors, obstacles
and intervals, of massive structure and fabulous extent.&nbsp;
This gentleman had taken up an attitude which had now passed into
the phase of correspondence and compromise; but it was the
opinion of the immediate neighbourhood that he had not a leg to
stand upon, and on whatever subject the sentiment of Jersey
Villas might have been vague, it was not so on the rights and the
wrongs of landladies.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s little boy was in the garden as Peter Baron
issued from the house, and his mother appeared to have come out
for a moment, bareheaded, to see that he was doing no harm.&nbsp;
She was discussing with him the responsibility that he might
incur by passing a piece of string round one of the iron palings
and pretending he was in command of a &ldquo;geegee&rdquo;; but
it happened that at the sight of the other lodger the child was
seized with a finer perception of the drivable.&nbsp; He rushed
at Baron with a flourish of the bridle, shouting, &ldquo;Ou
geegee!&rdquo; in a manner productive of some refined
embarrassment to his mother.&nbsp; Baron met his advance by
mounting him on a shoulder and feigning to prance an instant, so
that by the time this performance was over&mdash;it took but a
few seconds&mdash;the young man felt introduced to Mrs.
Ryves.&nbsp; Her smile struck him as charming, and such an
impression shortens many steps.&nbsp; She said, &ldquo;Oh, thank
you&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t let him worry you&rdquo;; and then
as, having put down the child and raised his hat, he was turning
away, she added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you not to
complain of my piano.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I particularly enjoy it&mdash;you play
beautifully,&rdquo; said Peter Baron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to play, you see&mdash;it&rsquo;s all I can
do.&nbsp; But the people next door don&rsquo;t like it, though my
room, you know, is not against their wall.&nbsp; Therefore I
thank you for letting me tell them that you, in the house,
don&rsquo;t find me a nuisance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked gentle and bright as she spoke, and as the young
man&rsquo;s eyes rested on her the tolerance for which she
expressed herself indebted seemed to him the least indulgence she
might count upon.&nbsp; But he only laughed and said &ldquo;Oh,
no, you&rsquo;re not a nuisance!&rdquo; and felt more and more
introduced.</p>
<p>The little boy, who was handsome, hereupon clamoured for
another ride, and she took him up herself, to moderate his
transports.&nbsp; She stood a moment with the child in her arms,
and he put his fingers exuberantly into her hair, so that while
she smiled at Baron she slowly, permittingly shook her head to
get rid of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they really make a fuss I&rsquo;m afraid I shall
have to go,&rdquo; she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; Baron broke out, with a
sudden expressiveness which made his voice, as it fell upon his
ear, strike him as the voice of another.&nbsp; She gave a vague
exclamation and, nodding slightly but not unsociably, passed back
into the house.&nbsp; She had made an impression which remained
till the other party to the conversation reached the
railway-station, when it was superseded by the thought of his
prospective discussion with Mr. Locket.&nbsp; This was a proof of
the intensity of that interest.</p>
<p>The aftertaste of the later conference was also intense for
Peter Baron, who quitted his editor with his manuscript under his
arm.&nbsp; He had had the question out with Mr. Locket, and he
was in a flutter which ought to have been a sense of triumph and
which indeed at first he succeeded in regarding in this
light.&nbsp; Mr. Locket had had to admit that there was an idea
in his story, and that was a tribute which Baron was in a
position to make the most of.&nbsp; But there was also a scene
which scandalised the editorial conscience and which the young
man had promised to rewrite.&nbsp; The idea that Mr. Locket had
been so good as to disengage depended for clearness mainly on
this scene; so it was easy to see his objection was
perverse.&nbsp; This inference was probably a part of the joy in
which Peter Baron walked as he carried home a contribution it
pleased him to classify as accepted.&nbsp; He walked to work off
his excitement and to think in what manner he should
reconstruct.&nbsp; He went some distance without settling that
point, and then, as it began to worry him, he looked vaguely into
shop-windows for solutions and hints.&nbsp; Mr. Locket lived in
the depths of Chelsea, in a little panelled, amiable house, and
Baron took his way homeward along the King&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp;
There was a new amusement for him, a fresher bustle, in a London
walk in the morning; these were hours that he habitually spent at
his table, in the awkward attitude engendered by the poor piece
of furniture, one of the rickety features of Mrs. Bundy&rsquo;s
second floor, which had to serve as his altar of literary
sacrifice.&nbsp; If by exception he went out when the day was
young he noticed that life seemed younger with it; there were
livelier industries to profit by and shop-girls, often rosy, to
look at; a different air was in the streets and a chaff of
traffic for the observer of manners to catch.&nbsp; Above all, it
was the time when poor Baron made his purchases, which were
wholly of the wandering mind; his extravagances, for some
mysterious reason, were all matutinal, and he had a foreknowledge
that if ever he should ruin himself it would be well before
noon.&nbsp; He felt lavish this morning, on the strength of what
the Promiscuous would do for him; he had lost sight for the
moment of what he should have to do for the Promiscuous.&nbsp;
Before the old bookshops and printshops, the crowded panes of the
curiosity-mongers and the desirable exhibitions of mahogany
&ldquo;done up,&rdquo; he used, by an innocent process, to commit
luxurious follies.&nbsp; He refurnished Mrs. Bundy with a freedom
that cost her nothing, and lost himself in pictures of a
transfigured second floor.</p>
<p>On this particular occasion the King&rsquo;s Road proved
almost unprecedentedly expensive, and indeed this occasion
differed from most others in containing the germ of real
danger.&nbsp; For once in a way he had a bad conscience&mdash;he
felt himself tempted to pick his own pocket.&nbsp; He never saw a
commodious writing-table, with elbow-room and drawers and a fair
expanse of leather stamped neatly at the edge with gilt, without
being freshly reminded of Mrs. Bundy&rsquo;s dilapidations.&nbsp;
There were several such tables in the King&rsquo;s
Road&mdash;they seemed indeed particularly numerous today.&nbsp;
Peter Baron glanced at them all through the fronts of the shops,
but there was one that detained him in supreme
contemplation.&nbsp; There was a fine assurance about it which
seemed a guarantee of masterpieces; but when at last he went in
and, just to help himself on his way, asked the impossible price,
the sum mentioned by the voluble vendor mocked at him even more
than he had feared.&nbsp; It was far too expensive, as he hinted,
and he was on the point of completing his comedy by a pensive
retreat when the shopman bespoke his attention for another
article of the same general character, which he described as
remarkably cheap for what it was.&nbsp; It was an old piece, from
a sale in the country, and it had been in stock some time; but it
had got pushed out of sight in one of the upper rooms&mdash;they
contained such a wilderness of treasures&mdash;and happened to
have but just come to light.&nbsp; Peter suffered himself to be
conducted into an interminable dusky rear, where he presently
found himself bending over one of those square substantial desks
of old mahogany, raised, with the aid of front legs, on a sort of
retreating pedestal which is fitted with small drawers,
contracted conveniences known immemorially to the knowing as
davenports.&nbsp; This specimen had visibly seen service, but it
had an old-time solidity and to Peter Baron it unexpectedly
appealed.</p>
<p>He would have said in advance that such an article was exactly
what he didn&rsquo;t want, but as the shopman pushed up a chair
for him and he sat down with his elbows on the gentle slope of
the large, firm lid, he felt that such a basis for literature
would be half the battle.&nbsp; He raised the lid and looked
lovingly into the deep interior; he sat ominously silent while
his companion dropped the striking words: &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s
an article I personally covet!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then when the man
mentioned the ridiculous price (they were literally giving it
away), he reflected on the economy of having a literary altar on
which one could really kindle a fire.&nbsp; A davenport was a
compromise, but what was all life but a compromise?&nbsp; He
could beat down the dealer, and at Mrs. Bundy&rsquo;s he had to
write on an insincere card-table.&nbsp; After he had sat for a
minute with his nose in the friendly desk he had a queer
impression that it might tell him a secret or two&mdash;one of
the secrets of form, one of the sacrificial
mysteries&mdash;though no doubt its career had been literary only
in the sense of its helping some old lady to write invitations to
dull dinners.&nbsp; There was a strange, faint odour in the
receptacle, as if fragrant, hallowed things had once been put
away there.&nbsp; When he took his head out of it he said to the
shopman: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind meeting you
halfway.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had been told by knowing people that
that was the right thing.&nbsp; He felt rather vulgar, but the
davenport arrived that evening at Jersey Villas.</p>
<h2>II.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="smcap">daresay</span> it will be all
right; he seems quiet now,&rdquo; said the poor lady of the
&ldquo;parlours&rdquo; a few days later, in reference to their
litigious neighbour and the precarious piano.&nbsp; The two
lodgers had grown regularly acquainted, and the piano had had
much to do with it.&nbsp; Just as this instrument served, with
the gentleman at No. 4, as a theme for discussion, so between
Peter Baron and the lady of the parlours it had become a basis of
peculiar agreement, a topic, at any rate, of conversation
frequently renewed.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves was so prepossessing that
Peter was sure that even if they had not had the piano he would
have found something else to thresh out with her.&nbsp;
Fortunately however they did have it, and he, at least, made the
most of it, knowing more now about his new friend, who when,
widowed and fatigued, she held her beautiful child in her arms,
looked dimly like a modern Madonna.&nbsp; Mrs. Bundy, as a letter
of furnished lodgings, was characterised in general by a familiar
domestic severity in respect to picturesque young women, but she
had the highest confidence in Mrs. Ryves.&nbsp; She was luminous
about her being a lady, and a lady who could bring Mrs. Bundy
back to a gratified recognition of one of those manifestations of
mind for which she had an independent esteem.&nbsp; She was
professional, but Jersey Villas could be proud of a profession
that didn&rsquo;t happen to be the wrong one&mdash;they had seen
something of that.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves had a hundred a year (Baron
wondered how Mrs. Bundy knew this; he thought it unlikely Mrs.
Ryves had told her), and for the rest she depended on her lovely
music.&nbsp; Baron judged that her music, even though lovely, was
a frail dependence; it would hardly help to fill a concert-room,
and he asked himself at first whether she played country-dances
at children&rsquo;s parties or gave lessons to young ladies who
studied above their station.</p>
<p>Very soon, indeed, he was sufficiently enlightened; it all
went fast, for the little boy had been almost as great a help as
the piano.&nbsp; Sidney haunted the doorstep of No.&nbsp; 3 he
was eminently sociable, and had established independent relations
with Peter, a frequent feature of which was an adventurous visit,
upstairs, to picture books criticised for not being <i>all</i>
geegees and walking sticks happily more conformable.&nbsp; The
young man&rsquo;s window, too, looked out on their acquaintance;
through a starched muslin curtain it kept his neighbour before
him, made him almost more aware of her comings and goings than he
felt he had a right to be.&nbsp; He was capable of a shyness of
curiosity about her and of dumb little delicacies of
consideration.&nbsp; She did give a few lessons; they were
essentially local, and he ended by knowing more or less what she
went out for and what she came in from.&nbsp; She had almost no
visitors, only a decent old lady or two, and, every day, poor
dingy Miss Teagle, who was also ancient and who came humbly
enough to governess the infant of the parlours.&nbsp; Peter
Baron&rsquo;s window had always, to his sense, looked out on a
good deal of life, and one of the things it had most shown him
was that there is nobody so bereft of joy as not to be able to
command for twopence the services of somebody less joyous.&nbsp;
Mrs. Ryves was a struggler (Baron scarcely liked to think of it),
but she occupied a pinnacle for Miss Teagle, who had lived
on&mdash;and from a noble nursery&mdash;into a period of diplomas
and humiliation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryves sometimes went out, like Baron himself, with
manuscripts under her arm, and, still more like Baron, she almost
always came back with them.&nbsp; Her vain approaches were to the
music-sellers; she tried to compose&mdash;to produce songs that
would make a hit.&nbsp; A successful song was an income, she
confided to Peter one of the first times he took Sidney,
blas&eacute; and drowsy, back to his mother.&nbsp; It was not on
one of these occasions, but once when he had come in on no better
pretext than that of simply wanting to (she had after all
virtually invited him), that she mentioned how only one song in a
thousand was successful and that the terrible difficulty was in
getting the right words.&nbsp; This rightness was just a vulgar
&ldquo;fluke&rdquo;&mdash;there were lots of words really clever
that were of no use at all.&nbsp; Peter said, laughing, that he
supposed any words he should try to produce would be sure to be
too clever; yet only three weeks after his first encounter with
Mrs. Ryves he sat at his delightful davenport (well aware that he
had duties more pressing), trying to string together rhymes
idiotic enough to make his neighbour&rsquo;s fortune.&nbsp; He
was satisfied of the fineness of her musical gift&mdash;it had
the touching note.&nbsp; The touching note was in her person as
well.</p>
<p>The davenport was delightful, after six months of its
tottering predecessor, and such a re-enforcement to the young
man&rsquo;s style was not impaired by his sense of something
lawless in the way it had been gained.&nbsp; He had made the
purchase in anticipation of the money he expected from Mr.
Locket, but Mr. Locket&rsquo;s liberality was to depend on the
ingenuity of his contributor, who now found himself confronted
with the consequence of a frivolous optimism.&nbsp; The fruit of
his labour presented, as he stared at it with his elbows on his
desk, an aspect uncompromising and incorruptible.&nbsp; It seemed
to look up at him reproachfully and to say, with its essential
finish: &ldquo;How could you promise anything so base; how could
you pass your word to mutilate and dishonour me?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
alterations demanded by Mr. Locket were impossible; the
concessions to the platitude of his conception of the public mind
were degrading.&nbsp; The public mind!&mdash;as if the public
<i>had</i> a mind, or any principle of perception more
discoverable than the stare of huddled sheep!&nbsp; Peter Baron
felt that it concerned him to determine if he were only not
clever enough or if he were simply not abject enough to rewrite
his story.&nbsp; He might in truth have had less pride if he had
had more skill, and more discretion if he had had more
practice.&nbsp; Humility, in the profession of letters, was half
of practice, and resignation was half of success.&nbsp; Poor
Peter actually flushed with pain as he recognised that this was
not success, the production of gelid prose which his editor could
do nothing with on the one side and he himself could do nothing
with on the other.&nbsp; The truth about his luckless tale was
now the more bitter from his having managed, for some days, to
taste it as sweet.</p>
<p>As he sat there, baffled and sombre, biting his pen and
wondering what was meant by the &ldquo;rewards&rdquo; of
literature, he generally ended by tossing away the composition
deflowered by Mr. Locket and trying his hand at the sort of
twaddle that Mrs. Ryves might be able to set to music.&nbsp;
Success in these experiments wouldn&rsquo;t be a reward of
literature, but it might very well become a labour of love.&nbsp;
The experiments would be pleasant enough for him if they were
pleasant for his inscrutable neighbour.&nbsp; That was the way he
thought of her now, for he had learned enough about her, little
by little, to guess how much there was still to learn.&nbsp; To
spend his mornings over cheap rhymes for her was certainly to
shirk the immediate question; but there were hours when he judged
this question to be altogether too arduous, reflecting that he
might quite as well perish by the sword as by famine.&nbsp;
Besides, he did meet it obliquely when he considered that he
shouldn&rsquo;t be an utter failure if he were to produce some
songs to which Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s accompaniments would give a
circulation.&nbsp; He had not ventured to show her anything yet,
but one morning, at a moment when her little boy was in his room,
it seemed to him that, by an inspiration, he had arrived at the
happy middle course (it was an art by itself), between sound and
sense.&nbsp; If the sense was not confused it was because the
sound was so familiar.</p>
<p>He had said to the child, to whom he had sacrificed
barley-sugar (it had no attraction for his own lips, yet in these
days there was always some of it about), he had confided to the
small Sidney that if he would wait a little he should be
intrusted with something nice to take down to his parent.&nbsp;
Sidney had absorbing occupation and, while Peter copied off the
song in a pretty hand, roamed, gurgling and sticky, about the
room.&nbsp; In this manner he lurched like a little toper into
the rear of the davenport, which stood a few steps out from the
recess of the window, and, as he was fond of beating time to his
intensest joys, began to bang on the surface of it with a
paper-knife which at that spot had chanced to fall upon the
floor.&nbsp; At the moment Sidney committed this violence his
kind friend had happened to raise the lid of the desk and, with
his head beneath it, was rummaging among a mass of papers for a
proper envelope.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say, I say, my boy!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, solicitous for the ancient glaze of his most cherished
possession.&nbsp; Sidney paused an instant; then, while Peter
still hunted for the envelope, he administered another, and this
time a distinctly disobedient, rap.&nbsp; Peter heard it from
within and was struck with its oddity of sound&mdash;so much so
that, leaving the child for a moment under a demoralising
impression of impunity, he waited with quick curiosity for a
repetition of the stroke.&nbsp; It came of course immediately,
and then the young man, who had at the same instant found his
envelope and ejaculated &ldquo;Hallo, this thing has a false
back!&rdquo; jumped up and secured his visitor, whom with his
left arm he held in durance on his knee while with his free hand
he addressed the missive to Mrs. Ryves.</p>
<p>As Sidney was fond of errands he was easily got rid of, and
after he had gone Baron stood a moment at the window chinking
pennies and keys in pockets and wondering if the charming
composer would think his song as good, or in other words as bad,
as he thought it.&nbsp; His eyes as he turned away fell on the
wooden back of the davenport, where, to his regret, the traces of
Sidney&rsquo;s assault were visible in three or four ugly
scratches.&nbsp; &ldquo;Confound the little brute!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, feeling as if an altar had been desecrated.&nbsp; He
was reminded, however, of the observation this outrage had led
him to make, and, for further assurance, he knocked on the wood
with his knuckle.&nbsp; It sounded from that position commonplace
enough, but his suspicion was strongly confirmed when, again
standing beside the desk, he put his head beneath the lifted lid
and gave ear while with an extended arm he tapped sharply in the
same place.&nbsp; The back was distinctly hollow; there was a
space between the inner and the outer pieces (he could measure
it), so wide that he was a fool not to have noticed it
before.&nbsp; The depth of the receptacle from front to rear was
so great that it could sacrifice a certain quantity of room
without detection.&nbsp; The sacrifice could of course only be
for a purpose, and the purpose could only be the creation of a
secret compartment.&nbsp; Peter Baron was still boy enough to be
thrilled by the idea of such a feature, the more so as every
indication of it had been cleverly concealed.&nbsp; The people at
the shop had never noticed it, else they would have called his
attention to it as an enhancement of value.&nbsp; His legendary
lore instructed him that where there was a hiding-place there was
always a hidden spring, and he pried and pressed and fumbled in
an eager search for the sensitive spot.&nbsp; The article was
really a wonder of neat construction; everything fitted with a
closeness that completely saved appearances.</p>
<p>It took Baron some minutes to pursue his inquiry, during which
he reflected that the people of the shop were not such fools
after all.&nbsp; They had admitted moreover that they had
accidentally neglected this relic of gentility&mdash;it had been
overlooked in the multiplicity of their treasures.&nbsp; He now
recalled that the man had wanted to polish it up before sending
it home, and that, satisfied for his own part with its honourable
appearance and averse in general to shiny furniture, he had in
his impatience declined to wait for such an operation, so that
the object had left the place for Jersey Villas, carrying
presumably its secret with it, two or three hours after his
visit.&nbsp; This secret it seemed indeed capable of keeping;
there was an absurdity in being baffled, but Peter couldn&rsquo;t
find the spring.&nbsp; He thumped and sounded, he listened and
measured again; he inspected every joint and crevice, with the
effect of becoming surer still of the existence of a chamber and
of making up his mind that his davenport was a rarity.&nbsp; Not
only was there a compartment between the two backs, but there was
distinctly something <i>in</i> the compartment!&nbsp; Perhaps it
was a lost manuscript&mdash;a nice, safe, old-fashioned story
that Mr. Locket wouldn&rsquo;t object to.&nbsp; Peter returned to
the charge, for it had occurred to him that he had perhaps not
sufficiently visited the small drawers, of which, in two vertical
rows, there were six in number, of different sizes, inserted
sideways into that portion of the structure which formed part of
the support of the desk.&nbsp; He took them out again and
examined more minutely the condition of their sockets, with the
happy result of discovering at last, in the place into which the
third on the left-hand row was fitted, a small sliding
panel.&nbsp; Behind the panel was a spring, like a flat button,
which yielded with a click when he pressed it and which instantly
produced a loosening of one of the pieces of the shelf forming
the highest part of the davenport&mdash;pieces adjusted to each
other with the most deceptive closeness.</p>
<p>This particular piece proved to be, in its turn, a sliding
panel, which, when pushed, revealed the existence of a smaller
receptacle, a narrow, oblong box, in the false back.&nbsp; Its
capacity was limited, but if it couldn&rsquo;t hold many things
it might hold precious ones.&nbsp; Baron, in presence of the
ingenuity with which it had been dissimulated, immediately felt
that, but for the odd chance of little Sidney Ryves&rsquo;s
having hammered on the outside at the moment he himself happened
to have his head in the desk, he might have remained for years
without suspicion of it.&nbsp; This apparently would have been a
loss, for he had been right in guessing that the chamber was not
empty.&nbsp; It contained objects which, whether precious or not,
had at any rate been worth somebody&rsquo;s hiding.&nbsp; These
objects were a collection of small flat parcels, of the shape of
packets of letters, wrapped in white paper and neatly
sealed.&nbsp; The seals, mechanically figured, bore the impress
neither of arms nor of initials; the paper looked old&mdash;it
had turned faintly sallow; the packets might have been there for
ages.&nbsp; Baron counted them&mdash;there were nine in all, of
different sizes; he turned them over and over, felt them
curiously and snuffed in their vague, musty smell, which affected
him with the melancholy of some smothered human accent.&nbsp; The
little bundles were neither named nor numbered&mdash;there was
not a word of writing on any of the covers; but they plainly
contained old letters, sorted and matched according to dates or
to authorship.&nbsp; They told some old, dead story&mdash;they
were the ashes of fires burned out.</p>
<p>As Peter Baron held his discoveries successively in his hands
he became conscious of a queer emotion which was not altogether
elation and yet was still less pure pain.&nbsp; He had made a
find, but it somehow added to his responsibility; he was in the
presence of something interesting, but (in a manner he
couldn&rsquo;t have defined) this circumstance suddenly
constituted a danger.&nbsp; It was the perception of the danger,
for instance, which caused to remain in abeyance any impulse he
might have felt to break one of the seals.&nbsp; He looked at
them all narrowly, but he was careful not to loosen them, and he
wondered uncomfortably whether the contents of the secret
compartment would be held in equity to be the property of the
people in the King&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; He had given money for the
davenport, but had he given money for these buried papers?&nbsp;
He paid by a growing consciousness that a nameless chill had
stolen into the air the penalty, which he had many a time paid
before, of being made of sensitive stuff.&nbsp; It was as if an
occasion had insidiously arisen for a sacrifice&mdash;a sacrifice
for the sake of a fine superstition, something like honour or
kindness or justice, something indeed perhaps even finer
still&mdash;a difficult deciphering of duty, an impossible
tantalising wisdom.&nbsp; Standing there before his ambiguous
treasure and losing himself for the moment in the sense of a
dawning complication, he was startled by a light, quick tap at
the door of his sitting-room.&nbsp; Instinctively, before
answering, he listened an instant&mdash;he was in the attitude of
a miser surprised while counting his hoard.&nbsp; Then he
answered &ldquo;One moment, please!&rdquo; and slipped the little
heap of packets into the biggest of the drawers of the davenport,
which happened to be open.&nbsp; The aperture of the false back
was still gaping, and he had not time to work back the
spring.&nbsp; He hastily laid a big book over the place and then
went and opened his door.</p>
<p>It offered him a sight none the less agreeable for being
unexpected&mdash;the graceful and agitated figure of Mrs.
Ryves.&nbsp; Her agitation was so visible that he thought at
first that something dreadful had happened to her
child&mdash;that she had rushed up to ask for help, to beg him to
go for the doctor.&nbsp; Then he perceived that it was probably
connected with the desperate verses he had transmitted to her a
quarter of an hour before; for she had his open manuscript in one
hand and was nervously pulling it about with the other.&nbsp; She
looked frightened and pretty, and if, in invading the privacy of
a fellow-lodger, she had been guilty of a departure from rigid
custom, she was at least conscious of the enormity of the step
and incapable of treating it with levity.&nbsp; The levity was
for Peter Baron, who endeavoured, however, to clothe his
familiarity with respect, pushing forward the seat of honour and
repeating that he rejoiced in such a visit.&nbsp; The visitor
came in, leaving the door ajar, and after a minute during which,
to help her, he charged her with the purpose of telling him that
he ought to be ashamed to send her down such rubbish, she
recovered herself sufficiently to stammer out that his song was
exactly what she had been looking for and that after reading it
she had been seized with an extraordinary, irresistible
impulse&mdash;that of thanking him for it in person and without
delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the impulse of a kind nature,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t tell you what pleasure you give
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She declined to sit down, and evidently wished to appear to
have come but for a few seconds.&nbsp; She looked confusedly at
the place in which she found herself, and when her eyes met his
own they struck him as anxious and appealing.&nbsp; She was
evidently not thinking of his song, though she said three or four
times over that it was beautiful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I only
wanted you to know, and now I must go,&rdquo; she added; but on
his hearthrug she lingered with such an odd helplessness that he
felt almost sorry for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I can improve it if you find it doesn&rsquo;t
go,&rdquo; said Baron.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so delighted to do
anything for you I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be a word or two that might be
changed,&rdquo; she answered, rather absently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shall have to think it over, to live with it a little.&nbsp; But
I like it, and that&rsquo;s all I wanted to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charming of you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a bit busy,&rdquo;
said Baron.</p>
<p>Again she looked at him with a troubled intensity, then
suddenly she demanded: &ldquo;Is there anything the matter with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean like being ill or worried.&nbsp; I wondered if
there might be; I had a sudden fancy; and that, I think, is
really why I came up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t, indeed; I&rsquo;m all right.&nbsp;
But your sudden fancies are inspirations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s absurd.&nbsp; You must excuse me.&nbsp;
Good-by!&rdquo; said Mrs. Ryves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the words you want changed?&rdquo; Baron
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any&mdash;if you&rsquo;re all
right.&nbsp; Good-by,&rdquo; his visitor repeated, fixing her
eyes an instant on an object on his desk that had caught
them.&nbsp; His own glanced in the same direction and he saw that
in his hurry to shuffle away the packets found in the davenport
he had overlooked one of them, which lay with its seals
exposed.&nbsp; For an instant he felt found out, as if he had
been concerned in something to be ashamed of, and it was only his
quick second thought that told him how little the incident of
which the packet was a sequel was an affair of Mrs.
Ryves&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Her conscious eyes came back to his as if
they were sounding them, and suddenly this instinct of keeping
his discovery to himself was succeeded by a really startled
inference that, with the rarest alertness, she had guessed
something and that her guess (it seemed almost supernatural), had
been her real motive.&nbsp; Some secret sympathy had made her
vibrate&mdash;had touched her with the knowledge that he had
brought something to light.&nbsp; After an instant he saw that
she also divined the very reflection he was then making, and this
gave him a lively desire, a grateful, happy desire, to appear to
have nothing to conceal.&nbsp; For herself, it determined her
still more to put an end to her momentary visit.&nbsp; But before
she had passed to the door he exclaimed: &ldquo;All right?&nbsp;
How can a fellow be anything else who has just had such a
find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused at this, still looking earnest and asking:
&ldquo;What have you found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some ancient family papers, in a secret compartment of
my writing-table.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he took up the packet he had
left out, holding it before her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;A lot of other
things like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Ryves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
sealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t broken the seals?&rdquo; She had come
further back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had time; it only happened ten minutes
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ryves, more gaily now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you were in some predicament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re extraordinary.&nbsp; I never heard of
anything so miraculous; down two flights of stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Are</i> you in a quandary?&rdquo; the visitor
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, about giving them back.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter Baron
stood smiling at her and rapping his packet on the palm of his
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you advise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She herself smiled now, with her eyes on the sealed
parcel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Back to whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man of whom I bought the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah then, they&rsquo;re not from <i>your</i>
family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed, the piece of furniture in which they were
hidden is not an ancestral possession.&nbsp; I bought it at
second hand&mdash;you see it&rsquo;s old&mdash;the other day in
the King&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; Obviously the man who sold it to me
sold me more than he meant; he had no idea (from his own point of
view it was stupid of him), that there was a hidden chamber or
that mysterious documents were buried there.&nbsp; Ought I to go
and tell him?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s rather a nice question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the papers of value?&rdquo; Mrs. Ryves
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea.&nbsp; But I can
ascertain by breaking a seal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Mrs. Ryves, with much
expression.&nbsp; She looked grave again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather tantalising&mdash;it&rsquo;s a bit of
a problem,&rdquo; Baron went on, turning his packet over.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryves hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you show me what you
have in your hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave her the packet, and she looked at it and held it for
an instant to her nose.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has a queer, charming old
fragrance,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charming?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s horrid.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
handed him back the packet, saying again more emphatically
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t break a seal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give back the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it honest to keep them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re yours as much as the
people&rsquo;s of the shop.&nbsp; They were in the hidden chamber
when the table came to the shop, and the people had every
opportunity to find them out.&nbsp; They
didn&rsquo;t&mdash;therefore let them take the
consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Baron reflected, diverted by her intensity.&nbsp; She
was pale, with eyes almost ardent.&nbsp; &ldquo;The table had
been in the place for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That proves the things haven&rsquo;t been
missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me show you how they were concealed,&rdquo; he
rejoined; and he exhibited the ingenious recess and the working
of the curious spring.&nbsp; She was greatly interested, she grew
excited and became familiar; she appealed to him again not to do
anything so foolish as to give up the papers, the rest of which,
in their little blank, impenetrable covers, he placed in a row
before her.&nbsp; &ldquo;They might be traced&mdash;their
history, their ownership,&rdquo; he argued; to which she replied
that this was exactly why he ought to be quiet.&nbsp; He declared
that women had not the smallest sense of honour, and she retorted
that at any rate they have other perceptions more delicate than
those of men.&nbsp; He admitted that the papers might be rubbish,
and she conceded that nothing was more probable; yet when he
offered to settle the point off-hand she caught him by the wrist,
acknowledging that, absurd as it was, she was nervous.&nbsp;
Finally she put the whole thing on the ground of his just doing
her a favour.&nbsp; She asked him to retain the papers, to be
silent about them, simply because it would please her.&nbsp; That
would be reason enough.&nbsp; Baron&rsquo;s acquaintance, his
agreeable relations with her, advanced many steps in the
treatment of this question; an element of friendly candour made
its way into their discussion of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out why it matters to you, one way
or the other, nor why you should think it worth talking
about,&rdquo; the young man reasoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither can I.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just a whim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if it will give you any pleasure, I&rsquo;ll
say nothing at the shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s charming of you, and I&rsquo;m very
grateful.&nbsp; I see now that this was why the spirit moved me
to come up&mdash;to save them,&rdquo; Mrs. Ryves went on.&nbsp;
She added, moving away, that now she had saved them she must
really go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To save them for what, if I mayn&rsquo;t break the
seals?&rdquo; Baron asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;for a generous
sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should it be generous?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s at
stake?&rdquo; Peter demanded, leaning against the doorpost as she
stood on the landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what, but I feel as if something or
other were in peril.&nbsp; Burn them up!&rdquo; she exclaimed
with shining eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you ask too much&mdash;I&rsquo;m so curious about
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t ask more than I ought, and
I&rsquo;m much obliged to you for your promise to be quiet.&nbsp;
I trust to your discretion.&nbsp; Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to <i>reward</i> my discretion,&rdquo; said
Baron, coming out to the landing.</p>
<p>She had partly descended the staircase and she stopped,
leaning against the baluster and smiling up at him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;ve had your reward in the honour of my
visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s delightful as far as it goes.&nbsp; But
what will you do for me if I burn the papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryves considered a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Burn them first
and you&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this she went rapidly downstairs, and Baron, to whom the
answer appeared inadequate and the proposition indeed in that
form grossly unfair, returned to his room.&nbsp; The vivacity of
her interest in a question in which she had discoverably nothing
at stake mystified, amused and, in addition, irresistibly charmed
him.&nbsp; She was delicate, imaginative, inflammable, quick to
feel, quick to act.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t complain of it, it was
the way he liked women to be; but he was not impelled for the
hour to commit the sealed packets to the flames.&nbsp; He dropped
them again into their secret well, and after that he went
out.&nbsp; He felt restless and excited; another day was lost for
work&mdash;the dreadful job to be performed for Mr. Locket was
still further off.</p>
<h2>III.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Ten</span> days after Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s
visit he paid by appointment another call on the editor of the
Promiscuous.&nbsp; He found him in the little wainscoted Chelsea
house, which had to Peter&rsquo;s sense the smoky brownness of an
old pipebowl, surrounded with all the emblems of his
office&mdash;a litter of papers, a hedge of encyclop&aelig;dias,
a photographic gallery of popular contributors&mdash;and he
promised at first to consume very few of the moments for which so
many claims competed.&nbsp; It was Mr. Locket himself however who
presently made the interview spacious, gave it air after
discovering that poor Baron had come to tell him something more
interesting than that he couldn&rsquo;t after all patch up his
tale.&nbsp; Peter had begun with this, had intimated respectfully
that it was a case in which both practice and principle rebelled,
and then, perceiving how little Mr. Locket was affected by his
audacity, had felt weak and slightly silly, left with his heroism
on his hands.&nbsp; He had armed himself for a struggle, but the
Promiscuous didn&rsquo;t even protest, and there would have been
nothing for him but to go away with the prospect of never coming
again had he not chanced to say abruptly, irrelevantly, as he got
up from his chair:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to be at all interested in Sir Dominick
Ferrand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket, who had also got up, looked over his
glasses.&nbsp; &ldquo;The late Sir Dominick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only one; you know the family&rsquo;s
extinct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket shot his young friend another sharp glance, a
silent retort to the glibness of this information.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very extinct indeed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid the subject
today would scarcely be regarded as attractive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you very sure?&rdquo; Baron asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Locket leaned forward a little, with his fingertips on his
table, in the attitude of giving permission to retire.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I might consider the question in a special
connection.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was silent a minute, in a way that
relegated poor Peter to the general; but meeting the young
man&rsquo;s eyes again he asked: &ldquo;Are
you&mdash;a&mdash;thinking of proposing an article upon
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly proposing it&mdash;because I don&rsquo;t
yet quite see my way; but the idea rather appeals to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket emitted the safe assertion that this eminent
statesman had been a striking figure in his day; then he added:
&ldquo;Have you been studying him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dipping into him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s scarcely a question of the
hour,&rdquo; said Mr. Locket, shuffling papers together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could make him one,&rdquo; Peter Baron
declared.</p>
<p>Mr. Locket stared again; he was unable to repress an
unattenuated &ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some new material,&rdquo; said the young man,
colouring a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;That often freshens up an old
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It buries it sometimes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s often only
another tombstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends upon what it is.&nbsp; However,&rdquo;
Peter added, &ldquo;the documents I speak of would be a crushing
monument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket, hesitating, shot another glance under his
glasses.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you allude
to&mdash;a&mdash;revelations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very curious ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket, still on his feet, had kept his body at the bowing
angle; it was therefore easy for him after an instant to bend a
little further and to sink into his chair with a movement of his
hand toward the seat Baron had occupied.&nbsp; Baron resumed
possession of this convenience, and the conversation took a fresh
start on a basis which such an extension of privilege could
render but little less humiliating to our young man.&nbsp; He had
matured no plan of confiding his secret to Mr. Locket, and he had
really come out to make him conscientiously that other
announcement as to which it appeared that so much artistic
agitation had been wasted.&nbsp; He had indeed during the past
days&mdash;days of painful indecision&mdash;appealed in
imagination to the editor of the Promiscuous, as he had appealed
to other sources of comfort; but his scruples turned their face
upon him from quarters high as well as low, and if on the one
hand he had by no means made up his mind not to mention his
strange knowledge, he had still more left to the determination of
the moment the question of how he should introduce the
subject.&nbsp; He was in fact too nervous to decide; he only felt
that he needed for his peace of mind to communicate his
discovery.&nbsp; He wanted an opinion, the impression of somebody
else, and even in this intensely professional presence, five
minutes after he had begun to tell his queer story, he felt
relieved of half his burden.&nbsp; His story was very queer; he
could take the measure of that himself as he spoke; but
wouldn&rsquo;t this very circumstance qualify it for the
Promiscuous?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course the letters may be forgeries,&rdquo; said Mr.
Locket at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt that&rsquo;s what many people will
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they been seen by any expert?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed; they&rsquo;ve been seen by
nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got any of them with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I felt nervous about bringing them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity.&nbsp; I should have liked the
testimony of my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have it if you&rsquo;ll come to my rooms.&nbsp;
If you don&rsquo;t care to do that without a further guarantee
I&rsquo;ll copy you out some passages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Select a few of the worst!&rdquo; Mr. Locket
laughed.&nbsp; Over Baron&rsquo;s distressing information he had
become quite human and genial.&nbsp; But he added in a moment
more dryly: &ldquo;You know they ought to be seen by an
expert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I dread,&rdquo; said
Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be worth nothing to me if they&rsquo;re
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter communed with his innermost spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
much will they be worth to <i>me</i> if they
<i>are</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket turned in his study-chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should
require to look at them before answering that
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to the British museum&mdash;there are
many of his letters there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve obtained permission
to see them, and I&rsquo;ve compared everything carefully.&nbsp;
I repudiate the possibility of forgery.&nbsp; No sign of
genuineness is wanting; there are details, down to the very
postmarks, that no forger could have invented.&nbsp; Besides,
whose interest could it conceivably have been?&nbsp; A labor of
unspeakable difficulty, and all for what advantage?&nbsp; There
are so many letters, too&mdash;twenty-seven in all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, what an ass!&rdquo; Mr. Locket exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be one of the strangest post-mortem revelations
of which history preserves the record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket, grave now, worried with a paper-knife the crevice
of a drawer.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very odd.&nbsp; But to be
worth anything such documents should be subjected to a searching
criticism&mdash;I mean of the historical kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; that would be the task of the writer
introducing them to the public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Mr. Locket considered; then with a smile he looked
up.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better give up original composition and
take to buying old furniture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean because it will pay better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you, I should think, original composition
couldn&rsquo;t pay worse.&nbsp; The creative faculty&rsquo;s so
rare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do feel tempted to turn my attention to real
heroes,&rdquo; Peter replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bound to declare that Sir Dominick Ferrand
was never one of mine.&nbsp; Flashy, crafty,
second-rate&mdash;that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve always read
him.&nbsp; It was never a secret, moreover, that his private life
had its weak spots.&nbsp; He was a mere flash in the
pan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He speaks to the people of this country,&rdquo; said
Baron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did; but his voice&mdash;the voice, I mean, of his
prestige&mdash;is scarcely audible now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re still proud of some of the things he did
at the Foreign Office&mdash;the famous &lsquo;exchange&rsquo;
with Spain, in the Mediterranean, which took Europe so by
surprise and by which she felt injured, especially when it became
apparent how much we had the best of the bargain.&nbsp; Then the
sudden, unexpected show of force by which he imposed on the
United States our interpretation of that tiresome treaty&mdash;I
could never make out what it was about.&nbsp; These were both
matters that no one really cared a straw about, but he made every
one feel as if they cared; the nation rose to the way he played
his trumps&mdash;it was uncommon.&nbsp; He was one of the few men
we&rsquo;ve had, in our period, who took Europe, or took America,
by surprise, made them jump a bit; and the country liked his
doing it&mdash;it was a pleasant change.&nbsp; The rest of the
world considered that they knew in any case exactly what we would
do, which was usually nothing at all.&nbsp; Say what you like,
he&rsquo;s still a high name; partly also, no doubt, on account
of other things his early success and early death, his political
&lsquo;cheek&rsquo; and wit; his very appearance&mdash;he
certainly was handsome&mdash;and the possibilities (of future
personal supremacy) which it was the fashion at the time, which
it&rsquo;s the fashion still, to say had passed away with
him.&nbsp; He had been twice at the Foreign Office; that alone
was remarkable for a man dying at forty-four.&nbsp; What
therefore will the country think when it learns he was
venal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Baron himself was not angry with Sir Dominick Ferrand,
who had simply become to him (he had been &ldquo;reading
up&rdquo; feverishly for a week) a very curious subject of
psychological study; but he could easily put himself in the place
of that portion of the public whose memory was long enough for
their patriotism to receive a shock.&nbsp; It was some time
fortunately since the conduct of public affairs had wanted for
men of disinterested ability, but the extraordinary documents
concealed (of all places in the world&mdash;it was as fantastic
as a nightmare) in a &ldquo;bargain&rdquo; picked up at
second-hand by an obscure scribbler, would be a calculable blow
to the retrospective mind.&nbsp; Baron saw vividly that if these
relics should be made public the scandal, the horror, the chatter
would be immense.&nbsp; Immense would be also the contribution to
truth, the rectification of history.&nbsp; He had felt for
several days (and it was exactly what had made him so nervous) as
if he held in his hand the key to public attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are too many things to explain,&rdquo; Mr. Locket
went on, &ldquo;and the singular <i>provenance</i> of your papers
would count almost overwhelmingly against them even if the other
objections were met.&nbsp; There would be a perfect and probably
a very complicated pedigree to trace.&nbsp; How did they get into
your davenport, as you call it, and how long had they been
there?&nbsp; What hands secreted them? what hands had, so
incredibly, clung to them and preserved them?&nbsp; Who are the
persons mentioned in them? who are the correspondents, the
parties to the nefarious transactions?&nbsp; You say the
transactions appear to be of two distinct kinds&mdash;some of
them connected with public business and others involving obscure
personal relations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all have this in common,&rdquo; said Peter Baron,
&ldquo;that they constitute evidence of uneasiness, in some
instances of painful alarm, on the writer&rsquo;s part, in
relation to exposure&mdash;the exposure in the one case, as I
gather, of the fact that he had availed himself of official
opportunities to promote enterprises (public works and that sort
of thing) in which he had a pecuniary stake.&nbsp; The dread of
the light in the other connection is evidently different, and
these letters are the earliest in date.&nbsp; They are addressed
to a woman, from whom he had evidently received money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket wiped his glasses.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea.&nbsp; There are lots of
questions I can&rsquo;t answer, of course; lots of identities I
can&rsquo;t establish; lots of gaps I can&rsquo;t fill.&nbsp; But
as to two points I&rsquo;m clear, and they are the essential
ones.&nbsp; In the first place the papers in my possession are
genuine; in the second place they&rsquo;re
compromising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this Peter Baron rose again, rather vexed with himself
for having been led on to advertise his treasure (it was his
interlocutor&rsquo;s perfectly natural scepticism that produced
this effect), for he felt that he was putting himself in a false
position.&nbsp; He detected in Mr. Locket&rsquo;s studied
detachment the fermentation of impulses from which, unsuccessful
as he was, he himself prayed to be delivered.</p>
<p>Mr. Locket remained seated; he watched Baron go across the
room for his hat and umbrella.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course, the
question would come up of whose property today such documents
would legally he.&nbsp; There are heirs, descendants, executors
to consider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some degree perhaps; but I&rsquo;ve gone into that a
little.&nbsp; Sir Dominick Ferrand had no children, and he left
no brothers and no sisters.&nbsp; His wife survived him, but she
died ten years ago.&nbsp; He can have had no heirs and no
executors to speak of, for he left no property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to his honour and against your
theory,&rdquo; said Mr. Locket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>have</i> no theory.&nbsp; He left a largeish mass
of debt,&rdquo; Peter Baron added.&nbsp; At this Mr. Locket got
up, while his visitor pursued: &ldquo;So far as I can ascertain,
though of course my inquiries have had to be very rapid and
superficial, there is no one now living, directly or indirectly
related to the personage in question, who would be likely to
suffer from any steps in the direction of publicity.&nbsp; It
happens to be a rare instance of a life that had, as it were, no
loose ends.&nbsp; At least there are none perceptible at
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Locket.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I don&rsquo;t think I should care much for your
article.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What article?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one you seem to wish to write, embodying this new
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t wish to write it!&rdquo; Peter
exclaimed.&nbsp; And then he bade his host good-by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said Mr. Locket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mind you,
I don&rsquo;t say that I think there&rsquo;s nothing in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would think there was something in it if you were
to see my documents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see the secret compartment,&rdquo; the
caustic editor rejoined.&nbsp; &ldquo;Copy me out some
extracts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what end, if there&rsquo;s no question of their
being of use to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that&mdash;I might like the letters
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as the basis of a paper, but just to
publish&mdash;for a sensation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d sell your number!&rdquo; Baron
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay I should like to look at them,&rdquo; Mr.
Locket conceded after a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;When should I find
you at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; said the young man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I make you no offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might make <i>you</i> one,&rdquo; the editor
hinted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself; I shall
probably destroy them.&rdquo;&nbsp; With this Peter Baron took
his departure, waiting however just afterwards, in the street
near the house, as if he had been looking out for a stray hansom,
to which he would not have signalled had it appeared.&nbsp; He
thought Mr. Locket might hurry after him, but Mr. Locket seemed
to have other things to do, and Peter Baron returned on foot to
Jersey Villas.</p>
<h2>IV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the evening that succeeded this
apparently pointless encounter he had an interview more
conclusive with Mrs. Bundy, for whose shrewd and philosophic view
of life he had several times expressed, even to the good woman
herself, a considerable relish.&nbsp; The situation at Jersey
Villas (Mrs. Ryves had suddenly flown off to Dover) was such as
to create in him a desire for moral support, and there was a kind
of domestic determination in Mrs. Bundy which seemed, in general,
to advertise it.&nbsp; He had asked for her on coming in, but had
been told she was absent for the hour; upon which he had
addressed himself mechanically to the task of doing up his
dishonoured manuscript&mdash;the ingenious fiction about which
Mr. Locket had been so stupid&mdash;for further adventures and
not improbable defeats.&nbsp; He passed a restless, ineffective
afternoon, asking himself if his genius were a horrid delusion,
looking out of his window for something that didn&rsquo;t happen,
something that seemed now to be the advent of a persuasive Mr.
Locket and now the return, from an absence more disappointing
even than Mrs. Bundy&rsquo;s, of his interesting neighbour of the
parlours.&nbsp; He was so nervous and so depressed that he was
unable even to fix his mind on the composition of the note with
which, on its next peregrination, it was necessary that his
manuscript should be accompanied.&nbsp; He was too nervous to
eat, and he forgot even to dine; he forgot to light his candles,
he let his fire go out, and it was in the melancholy chill of the
late dusk that Mrs. Bundy, arriving at last with his lamp, found
him extended moodily upon his sofa.&nbsp; She had been informed
that he wished to speak to her, and as she placed on the
malodorous luminary an oily shade of green pasteboard she
expressed the friendly hope that there was nothing wrong with his
&rsquo;ealth.</p>
<p>The young man rose from his couch, pulling himself together
sufficiently to reply that his health was well enough but that
his spirits were down in his hoots.&nbsp; He had a strong
disposition to &ldquo;draw&rdquo; his landlady on the subject of
Mrs. Ryves, as well as a vivid conviction that she constituted a
theme as to which Mrs. Bundy would require little pressure to
tell him even more than she knew.&nbsp; At the same time he hated
to appear to pry into the secrets of his absent friend; to
discuss her with their bustling hostess resembled too much for
his taste a gossip with a tattling servant about an unconscious
employer.&nbsp; He left out of account however Mrs. Bundy&rsquo;s
knowledge of the human heart, for it was this fine principle that
broke down the barriers after he had reflected reassuringly that
it was not meddling with Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s affairs to try and
find out if she struck such an observer as happy.&nbsp; Crudely,
abruptly, even a little blushingly, he put the direct question to
Mrs. Bundy, and this led tolerably straight to another question,
which, on his spirit, sat equally heavy (they were indeed but
different phases of the same), and which the good woman answered
with expression when she ejaculated: &ldquo;Think it a liberty
for you to run down for a few hours?&nbsp; If she do, my dear
sir, just send her to me to talk to!&rdquo;&nbsp; As regards
happiness indeed she warned Baron against imposing too high a
standard on a young thing who had been through so much, and
before he knew it he found himself, without the responsibility of
choice, in submissive receipt of Mrs. Bundy&rsquo;s version of
this experience.&nbsp; It was an interesting picture, though it
had its infirmities, one of them congenital and consisting of the
fact that it had sprung essentially from the virginal brain of
Miss Teagle.&nbsp; Amplified, edited, embellished by the richer
genius of Mrs. Bundy, who had incorporated with it and now
liberally introduced copious interleavings of Miss Teagle&rsquo;s
own romance, it gave Peter Baron much food for meditation, at the
same time that it only half relieved his curiosity about the
causes of the charming woman&rsquo;s underlying
strangeness.&nbsp; He sounded this note experimentally in Mrs.
Bundy&rsquo;s ear, but it was easy to see that it didn&rsquo;t
reverberate in her fancy.&nbsp; She had no idea of the picture it
would have been natural for him to desire that Mrs. Ryves should
present to him, and she was therefore unable to estimate the
points in respect to which his actual impression was
irritating.&nbsp; She had indeed no adequate conception of the
intellectual requirements of a young man in love.&nbsp; She
couldn&rsquo;t tell him why their faultless friend was so
isolated, so unrelated, so nervously, shrinkingly proud.&nbsp; On
the other hand she could tell him (he knew it already) that she
had passed many years of her life in the acquisition of
accomplishments at a seat of learning no less remote than
Boulogne, and that Miss Teagle had been intimately acquainted
with the late Mr. Everard Ryves, who was a &ldquo;most
rising&rdquo; young man in the city, not making any year less
than his clear twelve hundred.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now that he
isn&rsquo;t there to make them, his mourning widow can&rsquo;t
live as she had then, can she?&rdquo; Mrs. Bundy asked.</p>
<p>Baron was not prepared to say that she could, but he thought
of another way she might live as he sat, the next day, in the
train which rattled him down to Dover.&nbsp; The place, as he
approached it, seemed bright and breezy to him; his roamings had
been neither far enough nor frequent enough to make the
cockneyfied coast insipid.&nbsp; Mrs. Bundy had of course given
him the address he needed, and on emerging from the station he
was on the point of asking what direction he should take.&nbsp;
His attention however at this moment was drawn away by the bustle
of the departing boat.&nbsp; He had been long enough shut up in
London to be conscious of refreshment in the mere act of turning
his face to Paris.&nbsp; He wandered off to the pier in company
with happier tourists and, leaning on a rail, watched enviously
the preparation, the agitation of foreign travel.&nbsp; It was
for some minutes a foretaste of adventure; but, ah, when was he
to have the very draught?&nbsp; He turned away as he dropped this
interrogative sigh, and in doing so perceived that in another
part of the pier two ladies and a little boy were gathered with
something of the same wistfulness.&nbsp; The little boy indeed
happened to look round for a moment, upon which, with the
keenness of the predatory age, he recognised in our young man a
source of pleasures from which he lately had been weaned.&nbsp;
He bounded forward with irrepressible cries of
&ldquo;Geegee!&rdquo; and Peter lifted him aloft for an
embrace.&nbsp; On putting him down the pilgrim from Jersey Villas
stood confronted with a sensibly severe Miss Teagle, who had
followed her little charge.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter
with the old woman?&rdquo; he asked himself as he offered her a
hand which she treated as the merest detail.&nbsp; Whatever it
was, it was (and very properly, on the part of a loyal
<i>suivante</i>) the same complaint as that of her employer, to
whom, from a distance, for Mrs. Ryves had not advanced an inch,
he flourished his hat as she stood looking at him with a face
that he imagined rather white.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s response
to this salutation was to shift her position in such a manner as
to appear again absorbed in the Calais boat.&nbsp; Peter Baron,
however, kept hold of the child, whom Miss Teagle artfully
endeavoured to wrest from him&mdash;a policy in which he was
aided by Sidney&rsquo;s own rough but instinctive loyalty; and he
was thankful for the happy effect of being dragged by his
jubilant friend in the very direction in which he had tended for
so many hours.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves turned once more as he came near,
and then, from the sweet, strained smile with which she asked him
if he were on his way to France, he saw that if she had been
angry at his having followed her she had quickly got over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not crossing; but it came over me that
you might be, and that&rsquo;s why I hurried down&mdash;to catch
you before you were off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can&rsquo;t go&mdash;more&rsquo;s the pity; but
why, if we could,&rdquo; Mrs. Ryves inquired, &ldquo;should you
wish to prevent it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve something to ask you first,
something that may take some time.&rdquo;&nbsp; He saw now that
her embarrassment had really not been resentful; it had been
nervous, tremulous, as the emotion of an unexpected pleasure
might have been.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really why I
determined last night, without asking your leave first to pay you
this little visit&mdash;that and the intense desire for another
bout of horse-play with Sidney.&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;ve come to see
you,&rdquo; Peter Baron went on, &ldquo;and I won&rsquo;t make
any secret of the fact that I expect you to resign yourself
gracefully to the trial and give me all your time.&nbsp; The
day&rsquo;s lovely, and I&rsquo;m ready to declare that the place
is as good as the day.&nbsp; Let me drink deep of these things,
drain the cup like a man who hasn&rsquo;t been out of London for
months and months.&nbsp; Let me walk with you and talk with you
and lunch with you&mdash;I go back this afternoon.&nbsp; Give me
all your hours in short, so that they may live in my memory as
one of the sweetest occasions of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The emission of steam from the French packet made such an
uproar that Baron could breathe his passion into the young
woman&rsquo;s ear without scandalising the spectators; and the
charm which little by little it scattered over his fleeting visit
proved indeed to be the collective influence of the conditions he
had put into words.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it you wish to ask
me?&rdquo; Mrs. Ryves demanded, as they stood there together; to
which he replied that he would tell her all about it if she would
send Miss Teagle off with Sidney.&nbsp; Miss Teagle, who was
always anticipating her cue, had already begun ostentatiously to
gaze at the distant shores of France and was easily enough
induced to take an earlier start home and rise to the
responsibility of stopping on her way to contend with the
butcher.&nbsp; She had however to retire without Sidney, who
clung to his recovered prey, so that the rest of the episode was
seasoned, to Baron&rsquo;s sense, by the importunate twitch of
the child&rsquo;s little, plump, cool hand.&nbsp; The friends
wandered together with a conjugal air and Sidney not between
them, hanging wistfully, first, over the lengthened picture of
the Calais boat, till they could look after it, as it moved
rumbling away, in a spell of silence which seemed to
confess&mdash;especially when, a moment later, their eyes
met&mdash;that it produced the same fond fancy in each.&nbsp; The
presence of the boy moreover was no hindrance to their talking in
a manner that they made believe was very frank.&nbsp; Peter Baron
presently told his companion what it was he had taken a journey
to ask, and he had time afterwards to get over his discomfiture
at her appearance of having fancied it might be something
greater.&nbsp; She seemed disappointed (but she was forgiving) on
learning from him that he had only wished to know if she judged
ferociously his not having complied with her request to respect
certain seals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How ferociously do you suspect me of having judged
it?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to the extent of leaving the house the next
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were still lingering on the great granite pier when he
touched on this matter, and she sat down at the end while the
breeze, warmed by the sunshine, ruffled the purple sea.&nbsp; She
coloured a little and looked troubled, and after an instant she
repeated interrogatively: &ldquo;The next moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I told you what I had done.&nbsp; I was
scrupulous about this, you will remember; I went straight
downstairs to confess to you.&nbsp; You turned away from me,
saying nothing; I couldn&rsquo;t imagine&mdash;as I vow I
can&rsquo;t imagine now&mdash;why such a matter should appear so
closely to touch you.&nbsp; I went out on some business and when
I returned you had quitted the house.&nbsp; It had all the look
of my having offended you, of your wishing to get away from
me.&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t even give me time to tell you how it
was that, in spite of your advice, I determined to see for myself
what my discovery represented.&nbsp; You must do me justice and
hear what determined me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryves got up from her scat and asked him, as a particular
favour, not to allude again to his discovery.&nbsp; It was no
concern of hers at all, and she had no warrant for prying into
his secrets.&nbsp; She was very sorry to have been for a moment
so absurd as to appear to do so, and she humbly begged his pardon
for her meddling.&nbsp; Saying this she walked on with a charming
colour in her cheek, while he laughed out, though he was really
bewildered, at the endless capriciousness of women.&nbsp;
Fortunately the incident didn&rsquo;t spoil the hour, in which
there were other sources of satisfaction, and they took their
course to her lodgings with such pleasant little pauses and
excursions by the way as permitted her to show him the objects of
interest at Dover.&nbsp; She let him stop at a
wine-merchant&rsquo;s and buy a bottle for luncheon, of which, in
its order, they partook, together with a pudding invented by Miss
Teagle, which, as they hypocritically swallowed it, made them
look at each other in an intimacy of indulgence.&nbsp; They came
out again and, while Sidney grubbed in the gravel of the shore,
sat selfishly on the Parade, to the disappointment of Miss
Teagle, who had fixed her hopes on a fly and a ladylike visit to
the castle.&nbsp; Baron had his eye on his watch&mdash;he had to
think of his train and the dismal return and many other
melancholy things; but the sea in the afternoon light was a more
appealing picture; the wind had gone down, the Channel was
crowded, the sails of the ships were white in the purple
distance.&nbsp; The young man had asked his companion (he had
asked her before) when she was to come back to Jersey Villas, and
she had said that she should probably stay at Dover another
week.&nbsp; It was dreadfully expensive, but it was doing the
child all the good in the world, and if Miss Teagle could go up
for some things she should probably be able to manage an
extension.&nbsp; Earlier in the day she had said that she perhaps
wouldn&rsquo;t return to Jersey Villas at all, or only return to
wind up her connection with Mrs. Bundy.&nbsp; At another moment
she had spoken of an early date, an immediate reoccupation of the
wonderful parlours.&nbsp; Baron saw that she had no plan, no real
reasons, that she was vague and, in secret, worried and nervous,
waiting for something that didn&rsquo;t depend on herself.&nbsp;
A silence of several minutes had fallen upon them while they
watched the shining sails; to which Mrs. Ryves put an end by
exclaiming abruptly, but without completing her sentence:
&ldquo;Oh, if you had come to tell me you had destroyed
them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those terrible papers?&nbsp; I like the way you talk
about &lsquo;destroying!&rsquo;&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t even know
what they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know; they put me into a
state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a state?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; they haunt me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They haunted me; that was why, early one morning,
suddenly, I couldn&rsquo;t keep my hands off them.&nbsp; I had
told you I wouldn&rsquo;t touch them.&nbsp; I had deferred to
your whim, your superstition (what is it?) but at last they got
the better of me.&nbsp; I had lain awake all night threshing
about, itching with curiosity.&nbsp; It made me ill; my own
nerves (as I may say) were irritated, my capacity to work was
gone.&nbsp; It had come over me in the small hours in the shape
of an obsession, a fixed idea, that there was nothing in the
ridiculous relics and that my exaggerated scruples were making a
fool of me.&nbsp; It was ten to one they were rubbish, they were
vain, they were empty; that they had been even a practical joke
on the part of some weak-minded gentleman of leisure, the former
possessor of the confounded davenport.&nbsp; The longer I hovered
about them with such precautions the longer I was taken in, and
the sooner I exposed their insignificance the sooner I should get
back to my usual occupations.&nbsp; This conviction made my hand
so uncontrollable that that morning before breakfast I broke one
of the seals.&nbsp; It took me but a few minutes to perceive that
the contents were not rubbish; the little bundle contained old
letters&mdash;very curious old letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;I know; &lsquo;private and
confidential.&rsquo;&nbsp; So you broke the other
seals?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves looked at him with the strange
apprehension he had seen in her eyes when she appeared at his
door the moment after his discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, of course, because I told you an hour later,
though you would let me tell you very little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baron, as he met this queer gaze, smiled hard at her to
prevent her guessing that he smarted with the fine reproach
conveyed in the tone of her last words; but she appeared able to
guess everything, for she reminded him that she had not had to
wait that morning till he came downstairs to know what had
happened above, but had shown him at the moment how she had been
conscious of it an hour before, had passed on her side the same
tormented night as he, and had had to exert extraordinary
self-command not to rush up to his rooms while the study of the
open packets was going on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so
sensitively organised and you&rsquo;ve such mysterious powers
that you re uncanny,&rdquo; Baron declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel what takes place at a distance; that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would think somebody you liked was in
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you that that was what was present to me the day
I came up to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you don&rsquo;t like me so much as that,&rdquo;
Baron argued, laughing.</p>
<p>She hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know that I
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be for someone else&mdash;the other person
concerned.&nbsp; The other day, however, you wouldn&rsquo;t let
me tell you that person&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryves, at this, rose quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to know it; it&rsquo;s none of my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, fortunately, I don&rsquo;t think it is,&rdquo;
Baron rejoined, walking with her along the Parade.&nbsp; She had
Sidney by the hand now, and the young man was on the other side
of her.&nbsp; They moved toward the station&mdash;she had offered
to go part of the way.&nbsp; &ldquo;But with your miraculous gift
it&rsquo;s a wonder you haven&rsquo;t divined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only divine what I want,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ryves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very convenient!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter,
to whom Sidney had presently come round again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only,
being thus in the dark, it&rsquo;s difficult to see your motive
for wishing the papers destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryves meditated, looking fixedly at the ground.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I thought you might do it to oblige me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it strike you that such an expectation, formed in
such conditions, is reasonable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryves stopped short, and this time she turned on him the
clouded clearness of her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean to
do with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Peter Baron&rsquo;s turn to meditate, which he did, on
the empty asphalt of the Parade (the &ldquo;season,&rdquo; at
Dover, was not yet), where their shadows were long in the
afternoon light.&nbsp; He was under such a charm as he had never
known, and he wanted immensely to be able to reply:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything you like if you&rsquo;ll love
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words, however, would have represented a
responsibility and have constituted what was vulgarly termed an
offer.&nbsp; An offer of what? he quickly asked himself here, as
he had already asked himself after making in spirit other awkward
dashes in the same direction&mdash;of what but his poverty, his
obscurity, his attempts that had come to nothing, his abilities
for which there was nothing to show?&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves was not
exactly a success, but she was a greater success than Peter
Baron.&nbsp; Poor as he was he hated the sordid (he knew she
didn&rsquo;t love it), and he felt small for talking of
marriage.&nbsp; Therefore he didn&rsquo;t put the question in the
words it would have pleased him most to hear himself utter, but
he compromised, with an angry young pang, and said to her:
&ldquo;What will you do for me if I put an end to
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head sadly&mdash;it was always her prettiest
movement.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can promise nothing&mdash;oh, no, I
can&rsquo;t promise!&nbsp; We must part now,&rdquo; she
added.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll miss your train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at his watch, taking the hand she held out to
him.&nbsp; She drew it away quickly, and nothing then was left
him, before hurrying to the station, but to catch up Sidney and
squeeze him till he uttered a little shriek.&nbsp; On the way
back to town the situation struck him as grotesque.</p>
<h2>V.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> tormented him so the next
morning that after threshing it out a little further he felt he
had something of a grievance.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s
intervention had made him acutely uncomfortable, for she had
taken the attitude of exerting pressure without, it appeared,
recognising on his part an equal right.&nbsp; She had imposed
herself as an influence, yet she held herself aloof as a
participant; there were things she looked to him to do for her,
yet she could tell him of no good that would come to him from the
doing.&nbsp; She should either have had less to say or have been
willing to say more, and he asked himself why he should be the
sport of her moods and her mysteries.&nbsp; He perceived her
knack of punctual interference to be striking, but it was just
this apparent infallibility that he resented.&nbsp; Why
didn&rsquo;t she set up at once as a professional clairvoyant and
eke out her little income more successfully?&nbsp; In purely
private life such a gift was disconcerting; her divinations, her
evasions disturbed at any rate his own tranquillity.</p>
<p>What disturbed it still further was that he received early in
the day a visit from Mr. Locket, who, leaving him under no
illusion as to the grounds of such an honour, remarked as soon as
he had got into the room or rather while he still panted on the
second flight and the smudged little slavey held open
Baron&rsquo;s door, that he had taken up his young friend&rsquo;s
invitation to look at Sir Dominick Ferrand&rsquo;s letters for
himself.&nbsp; Peter drew them forth with a promptitude intended
to show that he recognised the commercial character of the call
and without attenuating the inconsequence of this departure from
the last determination he had expressed to Mr. Locket.&nbsp; He
showed his visitor the davenport and the hidden recess, and he
smoked a cigarette, humming softly, with a sense of unwonted
advantage and triumph, while the cautious editor sat silent and
handled the papers.&nbsp; For all his caution Mr. Locket was
unable to keep a warmer light out of his judicial eye as he said
to Baron at last with sociable brevity&mdash;a tone that took
many things for granted: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take them home with
me&mdash;they require much attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man looked at him a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
think they&rsquo;re genuine?&rdquo;&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t mean to
be mocking, he meant not to be; but the words sounded so to his
own ear, and he could see that they produced that effect on Mr.
Locket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t in the least determine.&nbsp; I shall
have to go into them at my leisure, and that&rsquo;s why I ask
you to lend them to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had shuffled the papers together with a movement charged,
while he spoke, with the air of being preliminary to that of
thrusting them into a little black bag which he had brought with
him and which, resting on the shelf of the davenport, struck
Peter, who viewed it askance, as an object darkly
editorial.&nbsp; It made our young man, somehow, suddenly
apprehensive; the advantage of which he had just been conscious
was about to be transferred by a quiet process of legerdemain to
a person who already had advantages enough.&nbsp; Baron, in
short, felt a deep pang of anxiety; he couldn&rsquo;t have said
why.&nbsp; Mr. Locket took decidedly too many things for granted,
and the explorer of Sir Dominick Ferrand&rsquo;s irregularities
remembered afresh how clear he had been after all about his
indisposition to traffic in them.&nbsp; He asked his visitor to
what end he wished to remove the letters, since on the one hand
there was no question now of the article in the Promiscuous which
was to reveal their existence, and on the other he himself, as
their owner, had a thousand insurmountable scruples about putting
them into circulation.</p>
<p>Mr. Locket looked over his spectacles as over the battlements
of a fortress.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking of the
end&mdash;I&rsquo;m thinking of the beginning.&nbsp; A few
glances have assured me that such documents ought to be submitted
to some competent eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t show them to anyone!&rdquo; Baron
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may think me presumptuous, but the eye that I
venture to allude to in those terms&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the eye now fixed so terribly on <i>me</i>?&rdquo;
Peter laughingly interrupted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, it would be
interesting, I confess, to know how they strike a man of your
acuteness!&rdquo;&nbsp; It had occurred to him that by such a
concession he might endear himself to a literary umpire hitherto
implacable.&nbsp; There would be no question of his publishing
Sir Dominick Ferrand, but he might, in due acknowledgment of
services rendered, form the habit of publishing Peter
Baron.&nbsp; &ldquo;How long would it be your idea to retain
them?&rdquo; he inquired, in a manner which, he immediately
became aware, was what incited Mr. Locket to begin stuffing the
papers into his bag.&nbsp; With this perception he came quickly
closer and, laying his hand on the gaping receptacle, lightly
drew its two lips together.&nbsp; In this way the two men stood
for a few seconds, touching, almost in the attitude of combat,
looking hard into each other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>The tension was quickly relieved however by the surprised
flush which mantled on Mr. Locket&rsquo;s brow.&nbsp; He fell
back a few steps with an injured dignity that might have been a
protest against physical violence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Really, my dear
young sir, your attitude is tantamount to an accusation of
intended bad faith.&nbsp; Do you think I want to steal the
confounded things?&rdquo;&nbsp; In reply to such a challenge
Peter could only hastily declare that he was guilty of no
discourteous suspicion&mdash;he only wanted a limit named, a
pledge of every precaution against accident.&nbsp; Mr. Locket
admitted the justice of the demand, assured him he would restore
the property within three days, and completed, with Peter&rsquo;s
assistance, his little arrangements for removing it
discreetly.&nbsp; When he was ready, his treacherous reticule
distended with its treasures, he gave a lingering look at the
inscrutable davenport.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s how they ever got
into that thing that puzzles one&rsquo;s brain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was some concatenation of circumstances that
would doubtless seem natural enough if it were explained, but
that one would have to remount the stream of time to
ascertain.&nbsp; To one course I have definitely made up my mind:
not to make any statement or any inquiry at the shop.&nbsp; I
simply accept the mystery,&rdquo; said Peter, rather grandly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be thought a cheap escape if you were to put
it into a story,&rdquo; Mr. Locket smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shouldn&rsquo;t offer the story to
<i>you</i>.&nbsp; I shall be impatient till I see my papers
again,&rdquo; the young man called out, as his visitor hurried
downstairs.</p>
<p>That evening, by the last delivery, he received, under the
Dover postmark, a letter that was not from Miss Teagle.&nbsp; It
was a slightly confused but altogether friendly note, written
that morning after breakfast, the ostensible purpose of which was
to thank him for the amiability of his visit, to express regret
at any appearance the writer might have had of meddling with what
didn&rsquo;t concern her, and to let him know that the evening
before, after he had left her, she had in a moment of inspiration
got hold of the tail of a really musical idea&mdash;a perfect
accompaniment for the song he had so kindly given her.&nbsp; She
had scrawled, as a specimen, a few bars at the end of her note,
mystic, mocking musical signs which had no sense for her
correspondent.&nbsp; The whole letter testified to a restless but
rather pointless desire to remain in communication with
him.&nbsp; In answering her, however, which he did that night
before going to bed, it was on this bright possibility of their
collaboration, its advantages for the future of each of them,
that Baron principally expatiated.&nbsp; He spoke of this future
with an eloquence of which he would have defended the sincerity,
and drew of it a picture extravagantly rich.&nbsp; The next
morning, as he was about to settle himself to tasks for some time
terribly neglected, with a sense that after all it was rather a
relief not to be sitting so close to Sir Dominick Ferrand, who
had become dreadfully distracting; at the very moment at which he
habitually addressed his preliminary invocation to the muse, he
was agitated by the arrival of a telegram which proved to be an
urgent request from Mr. Locket that he would immediately come
down and see him.&nbsp; This represented, for poor Baron, whose
funds were very low, another morning sacrificed, but somehow it
didn&rsquo;t even occur to him that he might impose his own time
upon the editor of the Promiscuous, the keeper of the keys of
renown.&nbsp; He had some of the plasticity of the raw
contributor.&nbsp; He gave the muse another holiday, feeling she
was really ashamed to take it, and in course of time found
himself in Mr. Locket&rsquo;s own chair at Mr. Locket&rsquo;s own
table&mdash;so much nobler an expanse than the slippery slope of
the davenport&mdash;considering with quick intensity, in the
white flash of certain words just brought out by his host, the
quantity of happiness, of emancipation that might reside in a
hundred pounds.</p>
<p>Yes, that was what it meant: Mr. Locket, in the twenty-four
hours, had discovered so much in Sir Dominick&rsquo;s literary
remains that his visitor found him primed with an offer.&nbsp; A
hundred pounds would be paid him that day, that minute, and no
questions would be either asked or answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I take
all the risks, I take all the risks,&rdquo; the editor of the
Promiscuous repeated.&nbsp; The letters were out on the table,
Mr. Locket was on the hearthrug, like an orator on a platform,
and Peter, under the influence of his sudden ultimatum, had
dropped, rather weakly, into the seat which happened to be
nearest and which, as he became conscious it moved on a pivot, he
whirled round so as to enable himself to look at his tempter with
an eye intended to be cold.&nbsp; What surprised him most was to
find Mr. Locket taking exactly the line about the expediency of
publication which he would have expected Mr. Locket not to
take.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hush it all up; a barren scandal, an offence
that can&rsquo;t be remedied, is the thing in the world that
least justifies an airing&mdash;&rdquo; some such line as that
was the line he would have thought natural to a man whose life
was spent in weighing questions of propriety and who had only the
other day objected, in the light of this virtue, to a work of the
most disinterested art.&nbsp; But the author of that
incorruptible masterpiece had put his finger on the place in
saying to his interlocutor on the occasion of his last visit
that, if given to the world in the pages of the Promiscuous, Sir
Dominick&rsquo;s aberrations would sell the edition.&nbsp; It was
not necessary for Mr. Locket to reiterate to his young friend his
phrase about their making a sensation.&nbsp; If he wished to
purchase the &ldquo;rights,&rdquo; as theatrical people said, it
was not to protect a celebrated name or to lock them up in a
cupboard.&nbsp; That formula of Baron&rsquo;s covered all the
ground, and one edition was a low estimate of the probable
performance of the magazine.</p>
<p>Peter left the letters behind him and, on withdrawing from the
editorial presence, took a long walk on the Embankment.&nbsp; His
impressions were at war with each other&mdash;he was flurried by
possibilities of which he yet denied the existence.&nbsp; He had
consented to trust Mr. Locket with the papers a day or two
longer, till he should have thought out the terms on which he
might&mdash;in the event of certain occurrences&mdash;be induced
to dispose of them.&nbsp; A hundred pounds were not this
gentleman&rsquo;s last word, nor perhaps was mere unreasoning
intractability Peter&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; He sighed as he took no
note of the pictures made by barges&mdash;sighed because it all
might mean money.&nbsp; He needed money bitterly; he owed it in
disquieting quarters.&nbsp; Mr. Locket had put it before him that
he had a high responsibility&mdash;that he might vindicate the
disfigured truth, contribute a chapter to the history of
England.&nbsp; &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t a right to suppress such
momentous facts,&rdquo; the hungry little editor had declared,
thinking how the series (he would spread it into three numbers)
would be the talk of the town.&nbsp; If Peter had money he might
treat himself to ardour, to bliss.&nbsp; Mr. Locket had said, no
doubt justly enough, that there were ever so many questions one
would have to meet should one venture to play so daring a
game.&nbsp; These questions, embarrassments, dangers&mdash;the
danger, for instance, of the cropping-up of some lurking
litigious relative&mdash;he would take over unreservedly and bear
the brunt of dealing with.&nbsp; It was to be remembered that the
papers were discredited, vitiated by their childish pedigree;
such a preposterous origin, suggesting, as he had hinted before,
the feeble ingenuity of a third-rate novelist, was a thing he
should have to place himself at the positive disadvantage of
being silent about.&nbsp; He would rather give no account of the
matter at all than expose himself to the ridicule that such a
story would infallibly excite.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t one see them
in advance, the clever, taunting things the daily and weekly
papers would say?&nbsp; Peter Baron had his guileless side, but
he felt, as he worried with a stick that betrayed him the granite
parapets of the Thames, that he was not such a fool as not to
know how Mr. Locket would &ldquo;work&rdquo; the mystery of his
marvellous find.&nbsp; Nothing could help it on better with the
public than the impenetrability of the secret attached to
it.&nbsp; If Mr. Locket should only be able to kick up dust
enough over the circumstances that had guided his hand his
fortune would literally be made.&nbsp; Peter thought a hundred
pounds a low bid, yet he wondered how the Promiscuous could bring
itself to offer such a sum&mdash;so large it loomed in the light
of literary remuneration as hitherto revealed to our young
man.&nbsp; The explanation of this anomaly was of course that the
editor shrewdly saw a dozen ways of getting his money back.&nbsp;
There would be in the &ldquo;sensation,&rdquo; at a later stage,
the making of a book in large type&mdash;the book of the hour;
and the profits of this scandalous volume or, if one preferred
the name, this reconstruction, before an impartial posterity, of
a great historical humbug, the sum &ldquo;down,&rdquo; in other
words, that any lively publisher would give for it, figured
vividly in Mr. Locket&rsquo;s calculations.&nbsp; It was
therefore altogether an opportunity of dealing at first hand with
the lively publisher that Peter was invited to forego.&nbsp;
Peter gave a masterful laugh, rejoicing in his heart that, on the
spot, in the <i>repaire</i> he had lately quitted, he had not
been tempted by a figure that would have approximately
represented the value of his property.&nbsp; It was a good job,
he mentally added as he turned his face homeward, that there was
so little likelihood of his having to struggle with that
particular pressure.</p>
<h2>VI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span>, half an hour later, he
approached Jersey Villas, he noticed that the house-door was
open; then, as he reached the gate, saw it make a frame for an
unexpected presence.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves, in her bonnet and jacket,
looked out from it as if she were expecting something&mdash;as if
she had been passing to and fro to watch.&nbsp; Yet when he had
expressed to her that it was a delightful welcome she replied
that she had only thought there might possibly be a cab in
sight.&nbsp; He offered to go and look for one, upon which it
appeared that after all she was not, as yet at least, in
need.&nbsp; He went back with her into her sitting-room, where
she let him know that within a couple of days she had seen
clearer what was best; she had determined to quit Jersey Villas
and had come up to take away her things, which she had just been
packing and getting together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote you last night a charming letter in answer to
yours,&rdquo; Baron said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mention
in yours that you were coming up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your answer that brought me.&nbsp; It
hadn&rsquo;t arrived when I came away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see when you get back that my letter is
charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay.&rdquo;&nbsp; Baron had observed that the
room was not, as she had intimated, in confusion&mdash;Mrs.
Ryves&rsquo;s preparations for departure were not striking.&nbsp;
She saw him look round and, standing in front of the fireless
grate with her hands behind her, she suddenly asked: &ldquo;Where
have you come from now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From an interview with a literary friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you concocting between you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve fallen out&mdash;we
don&rsquo;t agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he a publisher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an editor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you don&rsquo;t agree.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what he wants, but, whatever it is, don&rsquo;t
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must do what <i>I</i> want!&rdquo; said Baron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell you when he has done
it!&rdquo;&nbsp; Baron begged her to let him hear the
&ldquo;musical idea&rdquo; she had mentioned in her letter; on
which she took off her hat and jacket and, seating herself at her
piano, gave him, with a sentiment of which the very first notes
thrilled him, the accompaniment of his song.&nbsp; She phrased
the words with her sketchy sweetness, and he sat there as if he
had been held in a velvet vise, throbbing with the emotion,
irrecoverable ever after in its freshness, of the young artist in
the presence for the first time of
&ldquo;production&rdquo;&mdash;the proofs of his book, the
hanging of his picture, the rehearsal of his play.&nbsp; When she
had finished he asked again for the same delight, and then for
more music and for more; it did him such a world of good, kept
him quiet and safe, smoothed out the creases of his spirit.&nbsp;
She dropped her own experiments and gave him immortal things, and
he lounged there, pacified and charmed, feeling the mean little
room grow large and vague and happy possibilities come
back.&nbsp; Abruptly, at the piano, she called out to him:
&ldquo;Those papers of yours&mdash;the letters you
found&mdash;are not in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re not in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sure of it!&nbsp; No matter&mdash;it&rsquo;s all
right!&rdquo; she added.&nbsp; She herself was
pacified&mdash;trouble was a false note.&nbsp; Later he was on
the point of asking her how she knew the objects she had
mentioned were not in the house; but he let it pass.&nbsp; The
subject was a profitless riddle&mdash;a puzzle that grew
grotesquely bigger, like some monstrosity seen in the darkness,
as one opened one&rsquo;s eyes to it.&nbsp; He closed his
eyes&mdash;he wanted another vision.&nbsp; Besides, she had shown
him that she had extraordinary senses&mdash;her explanation would
have been stranger than the fact.&nbsp; Moreover they had other
things to talk about, in particular the question of her putting
off her return to Dover till the morrow and dispensing meanwhile
with the valuable protection of Sidney.&nbsp; This was indeed but
another face of the question of her dining with him somewhere
that evening (where else should she dine?)&mdash;accompanying
him, for instance, just for an hour of Bohemia, in their deadly
respectable lives, to a jolly little place in Soho.&nbsp; Mrs.
Ryves declined to have her life abused, but in fact, at the
proper moment, at the jolly little place, to which she did
accompany him&mdash;it dealt in macaroni and Chianti&mdash;the
pair put their elbows on the crumpled cloth and, face to face,
with their little emptied coffee-cups pushed away and the young
man&rsquo;s cigarette lighted by her command, became increasingly
confidential.&nbsp; They went afterwards to the theatre, in cheap
places, and came home in &ldquo;busses&rdquo; and under
umbrellas.</p>
<p>On the way back Peter Baron turned something over in his mind
as he had never turned anything before; it was the question of
whether, at the end, she would let him come into her sitting-room
for five minutes.&nbsp; He felt on this point a passion of
suspense and impatience, and yet for what would it be but to tell
her how poor he was?&nbsp; This was literally the moment to say
it, so supremely depleted had the hour of Bohemia left him.&nbsp;
Even Bohemia was too expensive, and yet in the course of the day
his whole temper on the subject of certain fitnesses had
changed.&nbsp; At Jersey Villas (it was near midnight, and Mrs.
Ryves, scratching a light for her glimmering taper, had said:
&ldquo;Oh, yes, come in for a minute if you like!&rdquo;), in her
precarious parlour, which was indeed, after the brilliances of
the evening, a return to ugliness and truth, she let him stand
while he explained that he had certainly everything in the way of
fame and fortune still to gain, but that youth and love and faith
and energy&mdash;to say nothing of her supreme
dearness&mdash;were all on his side.&nbsp; Why, if one&rsquo;s
beginnings were rough, should one add to the hardness of the
conditions by giving up the dream which, if she would only hear
him out, would make just the blessed difference?&nbsp; Whether
Mrs. Ryves heard him out or not is a circumstance as to which
this chronicle happens to be silent; but after he had got
possession of both her hands and breathed into her face for a
moment all the intensity of his tenderness&mdash;in the relief
and joy of utterance he felt it carry him like a rising
flood&mdash;she checked him with better reasons, with a cold,
sweet afterthought in which he felt there was something
deep.&nbsp; Her procrastinating head-shake was prettier than
ever, yet it had never meant so many fears and
pains&mdash;impossibilities and memories, independences and
pieties, and a sort of uncomplaining ache for the ruin of a
friendship that had been happy.&nbsp; She had liked him&mdash;if
she hadn&rsquo;t she wouldn&rsquo;t have let him think
so!&mdash;but she protested that she had not, in the odious
vulgar sense, &ldquo;encouraged&rdquo; him.&nbsp; Moreover she
couldn&rsquo;t talk of such things in that place, at that hour,
and she begged him not to make her regret her good-nature in
staying over.&nbsp; There were peculiarities in her position,
considerations insurmountable.&nbsp; She got rid of him with kind
and confused words, and afterwards, in the dull, humiliated
night, he felt that he had been put in his place.&nbsp; Women in
her situation, women who after having really loved and lost,
usually lived on into the new dawns in which old ghosts steal
away.&nbsp; But there was something in his whimsical neighbour
that struck him as terribly invulnerable.</p>
<h2>VII.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">I&rsquo;ve</span> had time to look
a little further into what we&rsquo;re prepared to do, and I find
the case is one in which I should consider the advisability of
going to an extreme length,&rdquo; said Mr. Locket.&nbsp; Jersey
Villas the next morning had had the privilege of again receiving
the editor of the Promiscuous, and he sat once more at the
davenport, where the bone of contention, in the shape of a large,
loose heap of papers that showed how much they had been handled,
was placed well in view.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall see our way to
offering you three hundred, but we shouldn&rsquo;t, I must
positively assure you, see it a single step further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Baron, in his dressing-gown and slippers, with his hands
in his pockets, crept softly about the room, repeating, below his
breath and with inflections that for his own sake he endeavoured
to make humorous: &ldquo;Three hundred&mdash;three
hundred.&rdquo;&nbsp; His state of mind was far from hilarious,
for he felt poor and sore and disappointed; but he wanted to
prove to himself that he was gallant&mdash;was made, in general
and in particular, of undiscourageable stuff.&nbsp; The first
thing he had been aware of on stepping into his front room was
that a four-wheeled cab, with Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s luggage upon it,
stood at the door of No. 3.&nbsp; Permitting himself, behind his
curtain, a pardonable peep, he saw the mistress of his thoughts
come out of the house, attended by Mrs. Bundy, and take her place
in the modest vehicle.&nbsp; After this his eyes rested for a
long time on the sprigged cotton back of the landlady, who kept
bobbing at the window of the cab an endlessly moralising old
head.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves had really taken flight&mdash;he had made
Jersey Villas impossible for her&mdash;but Mrs. Bundy, with a
magnanimity unprecedented in the profession, seemed to express a
belief in the purity of her motives.&nbsp; Baron felt that his
own separation had been, for the present at least, effected;
every instinct of delicacy prompted him to stand back.</p>
<p>Mr. Locket talked a long time, and Peter Baron listened and
waited.&nbsp; He reflected that his willingness to listen would
probably excite hopes in his visitor&mdash;hopes which he himself
was ready to contemplate without a scruple.&nbsp; He felt no pity
for Mr. Locket and had no consideration for his suspense or for
his possible illusions; he only felt sick and forsaken and in
want of comfort and of money.&nbsp; Yet it was a kind of outrage
to his dignity to have the knife held to his throat, and he was
irritated above all by the ground on which Mr. Locket put the
question&mdash;the ground of a service rendered to historical
truth.&nbsp; It might be&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t clear; it might
be&mdash;the question was deep, too deep, probably, for his
wisdom; at any rate he had to control himself not to interrupt
angrily such dry, interested palaver, the false voice of commerce
and of cant.&nbsp; He stared tragically out of the window and saw
the stupid rain begin to fall; the day was duller even than his
own soul, and Jersey Villas looked so sordidly hideous that it
was no wonder Mrs. Ryves couldn&rsquo;t endure them.&nbsp;
Hideous as they were he should have to tell Mrs. Bundy in the
course of the day that he was obliged to seek humbler
quarters.&nbsp; Suddenly he interrupted Mr. Locket; he observed
to him: &ldquo;I take it that if I should make you this
concession the hospitality of the Promiscuous would be by that
very fact unrestrictedly secured to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket stared.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hospitality&mdash;secured?&rdquo;&nbsp; He thumbed the
proposition as if it were a hard peach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that of course you wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;in
courtsey, in gratitude&mdash;keep on declining my
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should give them my best attention&mdash;as
I&rsquo;ve always done in the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Baron hesitated.&nbsp; It was a case in which there
would have seemed to be some chance for the ideally shrewd
aspirant in such an advantage as he possessed; but after a moment
the blood rushed into his face with the shame of the idea of
pleading for his productions in the name of anything but their
merit.&nbsp; It was as if he had stupidly uttered evil of
them.&nbsp; Nevertheless be added the interrogation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you for instance publish my little
story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one I read (and objected to some features of) the
other day?&nbsp; Do you mean&mdash;a&mdash;with the
alteration?&rdquo; Mr. Locket continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I mean utterly without it.&nbsp; The pages you
want altered contain, as I explained to you very lucidly, I
think, the very <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of the work, and
it would therefore, it seems to me, be an imbecility of the first
magnitude to cancel them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter had really renounced
all hope that his critic would understand what he meant, but,
under favour of circumstances, he couldn&rsquo;t forbear to taste
the luxury, which probably never again would come within his
reach, of being really plain, for one wild moment, with an
editor.</p>
<p>Mr. Locket gave a constrained smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think of the
scandal, Mr. Baron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t this other scandal just what
you&rsquo;re going in for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a great public service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it will be a big scandal, whereas my poor
story would be a very small one, and that it&rsquo;s only out of
a big one that money&rsquo;s to be made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket got up&mdash;he too had his dignity to
vindicate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such a sum as I offer you ought really to
be an offset against all claims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean to make any, since
you don&rsquo;t really care for what I write.&nbsp; I take note
of your offer,&rdquo; Peter pursued, &ldquo;and I engage to give
you to-night (in a few words left by my own hand at your house)
my absolutely definite and final reply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket&rsquo;s movements, as he hovered near the relics of
the eminent statesman, were those of some feathered parent
fluttering over a threatened nest.&nbsp; If he had brought his
huddled brood back with him this morning it was because he had
felt sure enough of closing the bargain to be able to be
graceful.&nbsp; He kept a glittering eye on the papers and
remarked that he was afraid that before leaving them he must
elicit some assurance that in the meanwhile Peter would not place
them in any other hands.&nbsp; Peter, at this, gave a laugh of
harsher cadence than he intended, asking, justly enough, on what
privilege his visitor rested such a demand and why he himself was
disqualified from offering his wares to the highest bidder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Surely you wouldn&rsquo;t hawk such things about?&rdquo;
cried Mr. Locket; but before Baron had time to retort cynically
he added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll publish your little story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll publish anything you&rsquo;ll send
me,&rdquo; Mr. Locket continued, as he went out.&nbsp; Peter had
before this virtually given his word that for the letters he
would treat only with the Promiscuous.</p>
<p>The young man passed, during a portion of the rest of the day,
the strangest hours of his life.&nbsp; Yet he thought of them
afterwards not as a phase of temptation, though they had been
full of the emotion that accompanies an intense vision of
alternatives.&nbsp; The struggle was already over; it seemed to
him that, poor as he was, he was not poor enough to take Mr.
Locket&rsquo;s money.&nbsp; He looked at the opposed courses with
the self-possession of a man who has chosen, but this
self-possession was in itself the most exquisite of
excitements.&nbsp; It was really a high revulsion and a sort of
noble pity.&nbsp; He seemed indeed to have his finger upon the
pulse of history and to be in the secret of the gods.&nbsp; He
had them all in his hand, the tablets and the scales and the
torch.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t keep a character together, but he
might easily pull one to pieces.&nbsp; That would be
&ldquo;creative work&rdquo; of a kind&mdash;he could reconstruct
the character less pleasingly, could show an unknown side of
it.&nbsp; Mr. Locket had had a good deal to say about
responsibility; and responsibility in truth sat there with him
all the morning, while he revolved in his narrow cage and,
watching the crude spring rain on the windows, thought of the
dismalness to which, at Dover, Mrs. Ryves was going back.&nbsp;
This influence took in fact the form, put on the physiognomy of
poor Sir Dominick Ferrand; he was at present as perceptible in
it, as coldly and strangely personal, as if he had been a
haunting ghost and had risen beside his own old
hearthstone.&nbsp; Our friend was accustomed to his company and
indeed had spent so many hours in it of late, following him up at
the museum and comparing his different portraits, engravings and
lithographs, in which there seemed to be conscious, pleading eyes
for the betrayer, that their queer intimacy had grown as close as
an embrace.&nbsp; Sir Dominick was very dumb, but he was terrible
in his dependence, and Peter would not have encouraged him by so
much curiosity nor reassured him by so much deference had it not
been for the young man&rsquo;s complete acceptance of the
impossibility of getting out of a tight place by exposing an
individual.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t matter that the individual was
dead; it didn&rsquo;t matter that he was dishonest.&nbsp; Peter
felt him sufficiently alive to suffer; he perceived the
rectification of history so conscientiously desired by Mr. Locket
to be somehow for himself not an imperative task.&nbsp; It had
come over him too definitely that in a case where one&rsquo;s
success was to hinge upon an act of extradition it would minister
most to an easy conscience to let the success go.&nbsp; No,
no&mdash;even should he be starving he couldn&rsquo;t make money
out of Sir Dominick&rsquo;s disgrace.&nbsp; He was almost
surprised at the violence of the horror with which, as he
shuffled mournfully about, the idea of any such profit inspired
him.&nbsp; What was Sir Dominick to him after all?&nbsp; He
wished he had never come across him.</p>
<p>In one of his brooding pauses at the window&mdash;the window
out of which never again apparently should he see Mrs. Ryves
glide across the little garden with the step for which he had
liked her from the first&mdash;he became aware that the rain was
about to intermit and the sun to make some grudging amends.&nbsp;
This was a sign that he might go out; he had a vague perception
that there were things to be done.&nbsp; He had work to look for,
and a cheaper lodging, and a new idea (every idea he had ever
cherished had left him), in addition to which the promised little
word was to be dropped at Mr. Locket&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; He
looked at his watch and was surprised at the hour, for he had
nothing but a heartache to show for so much time.&nbsp; He would
have to dress quickly, but as he passed to his bedroom his eye
was caught by the little pyramid of letters which Mr. Locket had
constructed on his davenport.&nbsp; They startled him and,
staring at them, he stopped for an instant, half-amused,
half-annoyed at their being still in existence.&nbsp; He had so
completely destroyed them in spirit that he had taken the act for
granted, and he was now reminded of the orderly stages of which
an intention must consist to be sincere.&nbsp; Baron went at the
papers with all his sincerity, and at his empty grate (where
there lately had been no fire and he had only to remove a
horrible ornament of tissue-paper dear to Mrs. Bundy) he burned
the collection with infinite method.&nbsp; It made him feel
happier to watch the worst pages turn to illegible ashes&mdash;if
happiness be the right word to apply to his sense, in the
process, of something so crisp and crackling that it suggested
the death-rustle of bank-notes.</p>
<p>When ten minutes later he came back into his sitting-room, he
seemed to himself oddly, unexpectedly in the presence of a bigger
view.&nbsp; It was as if some interfering mass had been so
displaced that he could see more sky and more country.&nbsp; Yet
the opposite houses were naturally still there, and if the grimy
little place looked lighter it was doubtless only because the
rain had indeed stopped and the sun was pouring in.&nbsp; Peter
went to the window to open it to the altered air, and in doing so
beheld at the garden gate the humble &ldquo;growler&rdquo; in
which a few hours before he had seen Mrs. Ryves take her
departure.&nbsp; It was unmistakable&mdash;he remembered the
knock-kneed white horse; but this made the fact that his
friend&rsquo;s luggage no longer surmounted it only the more
mystifying.&nbsp; Perhaps the cabman had already removed the
luggage&mdash;he was now on his box smoking the short pipe that
derived relish from inaction paid for.&nbsp; As Peter turned into
the room again his ears caught a knock at his own door, a knock
explained, as soon as he had responded, by the hard breathing of
Mrs. Bundy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, it&rsquo;s to say she&rsquo;ve come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has she come back for?&rdquo; Baron&rsquo;s
question sounded ungracious, but his heartache had given another
throb, and he felt a dread of another wound.&nbsp; It was like a
practical joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s for you, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Bundy.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll see you for a moment, if
you&rsquo;ll be so good, in the old place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter followed his hostess downstairs, and Mrs. Bundy ushered
him, with her company flourish, into the apartment she had fondly
designated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went away this morning, and I&rsquo;ve only returned
for an instant,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ryves, as soon as Mrs. Bundy had
closed the door.&nbsp; He saw that she was different now;
something had happened that had made her indulgent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been all the way to Dover and back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ve been to Victoria.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
left my luggage there&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been driving
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been to see Mr.
Morrish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Morrish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The musical publisher.&nbsp; I showed him our
song.&nbsp; I played it for him, and he&rsquo;s delighted with
it.&nbsp; He declares it&rsquo;s just the thing.&nbsp; He has
given me fifty pounds.&nbsp; I think he believes in us,&rdquo;
Mrs. Ryves went on, while Baron stared at the wonder&mdash;too
sweet to be safe, it seemed to him as yet&mdash;of her standing
there again before him and speaking of what they had in
common.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fifty pounds! fifty pounds!&rdquo; she
exclaimed, fluttering at him her happy cheque.&nbsp; She had come
back, the first thing, to tell him, and of course his share of
the money would be the half.&nbsp; She was rosy, jubilant,
natural, she chattered like a happy woman.&nbsp; She said they
must do more, ever so much more.&nbsp; Mr. Morrish had
practically promised he would take anything that was as good as
that.&nbsp; She had kept her cab because she was going to Dover;
she couldn&rsquo;t leave the others alone.&nbsp; It was a vehicle
infirm and inert, but Baron, after a little, appreciated its
pace, for she had consented to his getting in with her and
driving, this time in earnest, to Victoria.&nbsp; She had only
come to tell him the good news&mdash;she repeated this assurance
more than once.&nbsp; They talked of it so profoundly that it
drove everything else for the time out of his head&mdash;his duty
to Mr. Locket, the remarkable sacrifice he had just achieved, and
even the odd coincidence, matching with the oddity of all the
others, of her having reverted to the house again, as if with one
of her famous divinations, at the very moment the trumpery
papers, the origin really of their intimacy, had ceased to
exist.&nbsp; But she, on her side, also had evidently forgotten
the trumpery papers: she never mentioned them again, and Peter
Baron never boasted of what he had done with them.&nbsp; He was
silent for a while, from curiosity to see if her fine nerves had
really given her a hint; and then later, when it came to be a
question of his permanent attitude, he was silent, prodigiously,
religiously, tremulously silent, in consequence of an
extraordinary conversation that he had with her.</p>
<p>This conversation took place at Dover, when he went down to
give her the money for which, at Mr. Morrish&rsquo;s bank, he had
exchanged the cheque she had left with him.&nbsp; That cheque, or
rather certain things it represented, had made somehow all the
difference in their relations.&nbsp; The difference was huge, and
Baron could think of nothing but this confirmed vision of their
being able to work fruitfully together that would account for so
rapid a change.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t talk of impossibilities
now&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t seem to want to stop him off; only
when, the day following his arrival at Dover with the fifty
pounds (he had after all to agree to share them with her&mdash;he
couldn&rsquo;t expect her to take a present of money from him),
he returned to the question over which they had had their little
scene the night they dined together&mdash;on this occasion (he
had brought a portmanteau and he was staying) she mentioned that
there was something very particular she had it on her conscience
to tell him before letting him commit himself.&nbsp; There dawned
in her face as she approached the subject a light of warning that
frightened him; it was charged with something so strange that for
an instant he held his breath.&nbsp; This flash of ugly
possibilities passed however, and it was with the gesture of
taking still tenderer possession of her, checked indeed by the
grave, important way she held up a finger, that he answered:
&ldquo;Tell me everything&mdash;tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know what I am&mdash;who I am; you must know
especially what I&rsquo;m not!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a name for it,
a hideous, cruel name.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not my fault!&nbsp;
Others have known, I&rsquo;ve had to speak of it&mdash;it has
made a great difference in my life.&nbsp; Surely you must have
guessed!&rdquo; she went on, with the thinnest quaver of irony,
letting him now take her hand, which felt as cold as her hard
duty.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;ve no belongings,
no relations, no friends, nothing at all, in all the world, of my
own?&nbsp; I was only a poor girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poor girl?&rdquo; Baron was mystified, touched,
distressed, piecing dimly together what she meant, but feeling,
in a great surge of pity, that it was only something more to love
her for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother&mdash;my poor mother,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Ryves.</p>
<p>She paused with this, and through gathering tears her eyes met
his as if to plead with him to understand.&nbsp; He understood,
and drew her closer, but she kept herself free still, to
continue: &ldquo;She was a poor girl&mdash;she was only a
governess; she was alone, she thought he loved her.&nbsp; He
did&mdash;I think it was the only happiness she ever knew.&nbsp;
But she died of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you tell me&mdash;it&rsquo;s so
grand of you!&rdquo; Baron murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then&mdash;your
father?&rdquo;&nbsp; He hesitated, as if with his hands on old
wounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had his own troubles, but he was kind to her.&nbsp;
It was all misery and folly&mdash;he was married.&nbsp; He
wasn&rsquo;t happy&mdash;there were good reasons, I believe, for
that.&nbsp; I know it from letters, I know it from a person
who&rsquo;s dead.&nbsp; Everyone is dead now&mdash;it&rsquo;s too
far off.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the only good thing.&nbsp; He was
very kind to me; I remember him, though I didn&rsquo;t know then,
as a little girl, who he was.&nbsp; He put me with some very good
people&mdash;he did what he could for me.&nbsp; I think, later,
his wife knew&mdash;a lady who came to see me once after his
death.&nbsp; I was a very little girl, but I remember many
things.&nbsp; What he could he did&mdash;something that helped me
afterwards, something that helps me now.&nbsp; I think of him
with a strange pity&mdash;I <i>see</i> him!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Ryves, with the faint past in her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
mustn&rsquo;t say anything against him,&rdquo; she added, gently
and gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never&mdash;never; for he has only made it more of a
rapture to care for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must wait, you must think; we must wait
together,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell,
and you must give me time.&nbsp; Now that you know, it&rsquo;s
all right; but you had to know.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t it make us
better friends?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Ryves, with a tired smile which
had the effect of putting the whole story further and further
away.&nbsp; The next moment, however, she added quickly, as if
with the sense that it couldn&rsquo;t be far enough: &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t know, you can&rsquo;t judge, you must let it
settle.&nbsp; Think of it, think of it; oh you will, and leave it
so.&nbsp; I must have time myself, oh I must!&nbsp; Yes, you must
believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned away from him, and he remained looking at her a
moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, how I shall work for you!&rdquo; he
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must work for yourself; I&rsquo;ll help
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her eyes had met his eyes again, and she added,
hesitating, thinking: &ldquo;You had better know, perhaps, who he
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baron shook his head, smiling confidently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t care a straw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do&mdash;a little.&nbsp; He was a great
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must indeed have been some good in
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a high celebrity.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve often heard
of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baron wondered an instant.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt
you&rsquo;re a princess!&rdquo; he said with a laugh.&nbsp; She
made him nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ashamed of him.&nbsp; He was Sir Dominick
Ferrand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baron saw in her face, in a few seconds, that she had seen
something in his.&nbsp; He knew that he stared, then turned pale;
it had the effect of a powerful shock.&nbsp; He was cold for an
instant, as he had just found her, with the sense of danger, the
confused horror of having dealt a blow.&nbsp; But the blood
rushed back to its courses with his still quicker consciousness
of safety, and he could make out, as he recovered his balance,
that his emotion struck her simply as a violent surprise.&nbsp;
He gave a muffled murmur: &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s you, my
beloved!&rdquo; which lost itself as he drew her close and held
her long, in the intensity of his embrace and the wonder of his
escape.&nbsp; It took more than a minute for him to say over to
himself often enough, with his hidden face: &ldquo;Ah, she must
never, never know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She never knew; she only learned, when she asked him casually,
that he had in fact destroyed the old documents she had had such
a comic caprice about.&nbsp; The sensibility, the curiosity they
had had the queer privilege of exciting in her had lapsed with
the event as irresponsibly as they had arisen, and she appeared
to have forgotten, or rather to attribute now to other causes,
the agitation and several of the odd incidents that accompanied
them.&nbsp; They naturally gave Peter Baron rather more to think
about, much food, indeed, for clandestine meditation, some of
which, in spite of the pains he took not to be caught, was noted
by his friend and interpreted, to his knowledge, as depression
produced by the long probation she succeeded in imposing on
him.&nbsp; He was more patient than she could guess, with all her
guessing, for if he was put to the proof she herself was not left
undissected.&nbsp; It came back to him again and again that if
the documents he had burned proved anything they proved that Sir
Dominick Ferrand&rsquo;s human errors were not all of one
order.&nbsp; The woman he loved was the daughter of her father,
he couldn&rsquo;t get over that.&nbsp; What was more to the point
was that as he came to know her better and better&mdash;for they
did work together under Mr. Morrish&rsquo;s protection&mdash;his
affection was a quantity still less to be neglected.&nbsp; He
sometimes wondered, in the light of her general straightness
(their marriage had brought out even more than he believed there
was of it) whether the relics in the davenport were
genuine.&nbsp; That piece of furniture is still almost as useful
to him as Mr. Morrish&rsquo;s patronage.&nbsp; There is a
tremendous run, as this gentlemen calls it, on several of their
songs.&nbsp; Baron nevertheless still tries his hand also at
prose, and his offerings are now not always declined by the
magazines.&nbsp; But he has never approached the Promiscuous
again.&nbsp; This periodical published in due course a highly
eulogistic study of the remarkable career of Sir Dominick
Ferrand.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
